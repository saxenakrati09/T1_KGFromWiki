'''Ethanol''' (also called '''ethyl alcohol''', '''grain alcohol''', '''drinking alcohol''', '''spirits''', or simply '''alcohol''') is an [[Organic compound|organic]] [[chemical compound]].  It is a simple [[alcohol]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{chem|C|2|H|6|O}}. Its formula can be also written as {{chem|C|H|3}}−{{chem|C|H|2}}−{{chem|O|H}} or {{chem|C|2|H|5}}{{chem|O|H}} (an [[ethyl group]] linked to a [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl]] group), and is often [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] as '''EtOH'''. Ethanol is a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], [[Combustibility and flammability|flammable]], colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor. It is a [[Alcohol (drug)|psychoactive substance]], [[Recreational drug use|recreational drug]], and the active ingredient in [[alcoholic drink]]s.

Ethanol is naturally produced by the [[fermentation]] of [[sugar]]s by [[yeast]]s or via [[Petrochemistry|petrochemical]] processes such as ethylene hydration. It has medical applications as an [[antiseptic]] and [[disinfectant]]. It is used as a [[Chemistry|chemical]] [[solvent]] and in the [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of [[organic compound]]s. Ethanol is an alternative [[Alcohol fuel|fuel source]].

==Etymology==
''Ethanol'' is the [[systematic name]] defined by the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)]] for a compound consisting of [[alkyl group]] with two carbon [[atom]]s (prefix “eth-”), having a single bond between them (infix “-an-”), attached [[functional group]] −OH group (suffix “-ol”).&lt;ref name="Pubchem"&gt;{{cite web|title = Ethanol – Compound Summary|url = https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=702|website = The PubChem Project|location = USA|publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “eth-” prefix and the qualifier “ethyl” in “ethyl alcohol” originally come from the name “ethyl” assigned in 1834 to the group {{chem|C|2|H|5}}− by [[Justus von Liebig|Justus Liebig]]. He coined the word from the [[German language|German]] name ''Aether'' of the compound {{chem|C|2|H|5}}−O−{{chem|C|2|H|5}} (commonly called “ether” in [[English language|English]], more specifically called “[[diethyl ether]]”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Liebig | first = Justus | name-list-style = vanc | year = 1834 | title = Ueber die Constitution des Aethers und seiner Verbindungen | trans-title = On the constitution of ether and its compounds | language = de | doi = 10.1002/andp.18341072202 | journal = Annalen der Pharmacie | volume = 9 | issue = 22 | pages = 1–39 | quote = From page 18: "''Bezeichnen wir die Kohlenwasserstoffverbindung 4C + 10H als das Radikal des Aethers mit E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; und nennen es Ethyl'', ..." (Let us designate the hydrocarbon compound 4C + 10H as the radical of ether with E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and name it ethyl ...). | bibcode = 1834AnP...107..337L | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1423568 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''Ethyl'' is a contraction of the Ancient Greek [[wikt:αἰθήρ#Ancient Greek|αἰθήρ]] (''{{transl|grc|aithḗr}}'', “upper air”) and the Greek word [[wikt:ὕλη#Ancient Greek|ὕλη]] (''{{transl|grc|hýlē}}'', “substance”).&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|ethyl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''ethanol'' was coined as a result of a resolution that was adopted at the International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature that was held in April 1892 in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;For a report on the 1892 International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature, see:
* {{cite journal| last = Armstrong | first = Henry | name-list-style = vanc |year=1892|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LHkCAAAAIAAJ|page=56}} |title=The International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature|journal=Nature|volume=46|pages=56–59|doi=10.1038/046056c0|issue=1177|bibcode=1892Natur..46...56A|doi-access=free}}
* Armstrong's report is reprinted with the resolutions in English in: {{cite journal| last = Armstrong | first = Henry | name-list-style = vanc |year=1892|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RogMAQAAIAAJ|page=398}}|title=The International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature|journal=The Journal of Analytical and Applied Chemistry|volume=6|issue=1177|pages= 390–400 (398)|quote= The alcohols and the phenols will be called after the name of the hydrocarbon from which they are derived, terminated with the suffix ''ol'' (ex. pentanol, pentynol, etc.) | bibcode = 1892Natur..46...56A | doi = 10.1038/046056c0 |doi-access= free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “[[alcohol]]” now refers to a wider class of substances in chemistry nomenclature, but in common parlance it remains the name of ethanol. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' claims that it is a medieval loan from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[Kohl (cosmetics)|al-kuḥl]]'', a powdered ore of antimony used since antiquity as a cosmetic, and retained that meaning in [[Middle Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]; [[etymonline.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of “alcohol” for ethanol (in full, “alcohol of wine”) is modern, first recorded 1753, and by the later 18th century referred to “any sublimated substance”; “[[Distilled beverage|distilled spirit]]” used for “the spirit of wine” (shortened from a full expression ''the spirit of'' ''alcohol of wine''). The systematic use in chemistry dates to 1850.

==Uses==

===Medical===
{{Main|Alcohol (medicine)}}

====Antiseptic====
Ethanol is used in medical wipes and most commonly in antibacterial [[hand sanitizer]] gels as an [[antiseptic]] for its bactericidal and anti-fungal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pohorecky |first1=Larissa A. |last2=Brick |first2=John |title=Pharmacology of ethanol |journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics |date=January 1988 |volume=36 |issue=2–3 |pages=335–427 |doi=10.1016/0163-7258(88)90109-X |pmid=3279433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethanol kills [[microorganism]]s by dissolving their membrane [[lipid bilayer]] and [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] their [[protein]]s, and is effective against most [[bacteria]] and [[fungus|fungi]] and [[virus]]es. However, it is ineffective against bacterial [[Endospore|spores]], but that can be alleviated by using [[hydrogen peroxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonnell G, Russell AD | title = Antiseptics and disinfectants: activity, action, and resistance | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–79 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9880479 | pmc = 88911 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.12.1.147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A solution of 70% ethanol is more effective than pure ethanol because ethanol relies on water molecules for optimal antimicrobial activity. Absolute ethanol may inactivate microbes without destroying them because the alcohol is unable to fully permeate the microbe's membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/disinfection-methods/chemical.html|title=Chemical Disinfectants {{!}} Disinfection &amp; Sterilization Guidelines {{!}} Guidelines Library {{!}} Infection Control {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_is_70_ethanol_used_for_wiping_microbiological_working_areas|title=Why is 70% ethanol used for wiping microbiological working areas?|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethanol can also be used as a disinfectant and antiseptic because it causes cell dehydration by disrupting the osmotic balance across cell membrane, so water leaves the cell leading to cell death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethanol |url=https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898 |website=www.drugbank.ca |access-date=28 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antidote====
Ethanol may be administered as an [[antidote]] to [[ethylene glycol poisoning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scalley|first1=Robert | name-list-style = vanc |title=Treatment of Ethylene Glycol Poisoning|journal=American Family Physician|date=September 2002|volume=66|issue=5|pages=807–813|pmid=12322772 |url=https://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0901/p807.html|access-date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[methanol poisoning]].&lt;ref name=EM2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beauchamp|first1=GA|last2=Valento|first2=M|title=Toxic Alcohol Ingestion: Prompt Recognition And Management In The Emergency Department.|journal=Emergency Medicine Practice|date=September 2016|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1–20|pmid=27538060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medicinal solvent====
Ethanol, often in high concentrations, is used to dissolve many water-insoluble medications and related compounds. Liquid preparations of [[analgesics|pain medications]], [[Cold medicine|cough and cold medicines]], and mouth washes, for example, may contain up to 25% ethanol&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.mssny.org/App_Themes/MSSNY/pdf/AlcoholContent.pdf | title = Alcohol Content in Common Preparations | publisher = Medical Society of the State of New York | access-date = October 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may need to be avoided in individuals with adverse reactions to ethanol such as [[alcohol-induced respiratory reactions]].&lt;ref name="Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams KE, Rans TS | title = Adverse reactions to alcohol and alcoholic beverages | journal = Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology | volume = 111 | issue = 6 | pages = 439–45 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24267355 | doi = 10.1016/j.anai.2013.09.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethanol is present mainly as an antimicrobial preservative in over 700 liquid preparations of medicine including [[acetaminophen]], [[iron supplement]]s, [[ranitidine]], [[furosemide]], [[mannitol]], [[phenobarbital]], [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]] and [[over-the-counter]] [[cough medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zuccotti GV, Fabiano V | title = Safety issues with ethanol as an excipient in drugs intended for pediatric use | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Safety | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 499–502 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21417862 | doi = 10.1517/14740338.2011.565328 | s2cid = 41876817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pharmacology====
If ingested orally, ethanol is extensively metabolized by the liver, particularly via the [[enzyme]]  [[CYP450]].&lt;ref name="Harger_1958"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harger RN | title = The pharmacology and toxicology of alcohol | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 167 | issue = 18 | pages = 2199–202 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13563225 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1958.72990350014007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethyl alcohol increases the secretion of acids in the stomach.&lt;ref name="Harger_1958" /&gt; The metabolite [[acetaldehyde]] is responsible for much of the short term, and long term effects of ethyl alcohol toxicity.&lt;ref name="Wallner_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wallner M, Olsen RW | title = Physiology and pharmacology of alcohol: the imidazobenzodiazepine alcohol antagonist site on subtypes of GABAA receptors as an opportunity for drug development? | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 288–98 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18278063 | pmc = 2442438 | doi = 10.1038/bjp.2008.32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recreational===
{{Main|Alcohol (drug)|Alcoholic drink}}

As a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]], ethanol is one of the most commonly consumed [[psychoactive drug]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001944.htm Alcohol use and safe drinking]. US National Institutes of Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite alcohol having psychoactive properties, it is readily available and legal for sale in most countries. However, there are laws regulating the sale, exportation/importation, taxation, manufacturing, consumption, and possession of alcoholic beverages. The most common regulation is prohibition for minors. &lt;!-- Some countries, such as the U.S., have a minimum legal drinking age of 21, which is higher than the legal age of majority. ←This statement is not accurate.

The largest single use of ethanol is as an engine [[fuel]] and [[fuel additive]]. [[Brazil]] in particular relies heavily upon the use of ethanol as an engine fuel, due in part to its role as one of the globe's leading producers of ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Availability of Sources of E85|url=http://www.cleanairtrust.org/Sources-Availability-E85.html|website=Clean Air Trust|access-date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gasoline]] sold in Brazil contains at least 25% [[anhydrous]] ethanol. Hydrous ethanol (about 95% ethanol and 5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new gasoline fueled cars sold in the country. Brazilian ethanol is produced from [[sugar cane]] and noted for high [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref name="WaPo-Brazil"&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Reel M | date = 19 August 2006 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/19/AR2006081900842.html | title = Brazil's Road to Energy Independence | website = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US and many other countries primarily use E10 (10% ethanol, sometimes known as gasohol) and E85 (85% ethanol) ethanol/gasoline mixtures.

World production of ethanol in 2006 was {{convert|51|GL|usgal}}, with 69% of the world supply coming from Brazil and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 2008 World Fuel Ethanol Production|url = http://www.ethanolrfa.org/pages/statistics/#E|location = U.S.|publisher = Renewable Fuels Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 20% of Brazilian cars are able to use 100% ethanol as fuel, which includes ethanol-only engines and [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,tecnologia-flex-em-automoveis-atrai-estrangeiros,178105|title = Tecnologia flex atrai estrangeiros|publisher = Agência Estado}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flex-fuel engines in Brazil are able to work with all ethanol, all gasoline or any mixture of both. In the US flex-fuel vehicles can run on 0% to 85% ethanol (15% gasoline) since higher ethanol blends are not yet allowed or efficient. Brazil supports this fleet of ethanol-burning automobiles with large national infrastructure that produces ethanol from domestically grown [[sugar cane]]. [[Sugar cane]] not only has a greater concentration of sucrose than corn (by about 30%), but is also much easier to extract. The [[bagasse]] generated by the process is not wasted, but is used in power plants to produce electricity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

====Rocket fuel====
Ethanol was commonly used as fuel in early [[bipropellant]] [[rocket]] (liquid-propelled) vehicles, in conjunction with an [[oxidizer]] such as liquid oxygen. The German A-4 ballistic rocket, better known by its propaganda name [[V-2 rocket]] of [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=John D. |title=Ingnition! An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants |date= 2017 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick, N.j. |isbn=978-0-8135-9583-2 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; credited with beginning the space age, used ethanol as the main constituent of [[List of stoffs#List|''B-Stoff'']]. Under such nomenclature, the ethanol was mixed with 25% water to reduce the combustion chamber temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/V/V-2.html|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science: V-2| last = Darling | first = David | name-list-style = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="braeunig"&gt;Braeunig, Robert A. [http://braeunig.us/space/propel.htm "Rocket Propellants."] (Website). Rocket &amp; Space Technology, 2006. Retrieved 23 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The V-2's design team helped develop U.S. rockets following World War II, including the ethanol-fueled [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone rocket]] which launched the first U.S. satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/rocket-history.txt "A Brief History of Rocketry."] NASA Historical Archive, via science.ksc.nasa.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohols fell into general disuse as more energy-dense rocket fuels were developed.&lt;ref name="braeunig" /&gt;

====Fuel cells====
Commercial fuel cells operate on reformed natural gas, [[hydrogen]] or [[methanol]]. Ethanol is an attractive alternative due to its wide availability, low cost, high purity and low toxicity. There are a wide range of fuel cell concepts that have entered trials including [[direct-ethanol fuel cell]]s, auto-thermal reforming systems and thermally integrated systems. The majority of work is being conducted at a research level although there are a number of organizations at the beginning of commercialization of ethanol fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Badwal SP, Giddey S, Kulkarni A, Goel J, Basu S | title = Direct ethanol fuel cells for transport and stationary applications – A comprehensive review|journal=Applied Energy|date=May 2015|volume=145|pages=80–103|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Household heating====
Ethanol fireplaces can be used for home heating or for decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Can Ethanol Fireplaces Be Cozy?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-fire-please-hold-the-soot-1449170833|access-date=2 March 2016|agency=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethanol is an important industrial ingredient. It has widespread use as a precursor for other organic compounds such as ethyl [[halide]]s, ethyl [[ester]]s, diethyl ether, acetic acid, and ethyl [[amine]]s.

===Solvent===
Ethanol is considered a universal [[solvent]], as its [[Molecule|molecular]] structure allows for the dissolving of both [[Chemical polarity#Polar molecules|polar]], [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] and [[Chemical polarity#Nonpolar molecules|nonpolar]], [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] compounds. As ethanol also has a low [[boiling point]], it is easy to remove from a solution that has been used to dissolve other compounds, making it a popular extracting agent for botanical oils. [[Cannabis]] oil extraction methods often use ethanol as an extraction [[solvent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/article/your-guide-to-ethanol-extraction/|title=Your Guide to Ethanol Extraction|website=Cannabis Business Times|language=en|access-date=2019-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also as a post-processing solvent to remove oils, waxes, and [[chlorophyll]] from solution in a process known as [[Winterization of oil|winterization]].

Ethanol is found in [[paint]]s, [[tincture]]s, markers, and personal care products such as mouthwashes, perfumes and deodorants. However, [[polysaccharides]] [[Ethanol precipitation|precipitate]] from aqueous solution in the presence of alcohol, and ethanol precipitation is used for this reason in the purification of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].

===Low-temperature liquid===
Because of its low freezing point -173.20°F (−114.14&amp;nbsp;°C) and low toxicity, ethanol is sometimes used in laboratories (with [[dry ice]] or other coolants) as a [[cooling bath]] to keep vessels at temperatures below the freezing point of water. For the same reason, it is also used as the active fluid in [[alcohol thermometer]]s.

==Chemistry==
{{Further|Ethanol (data page)}}

===Chemical formula===
Ethanol is a 2-carbon alcohol. Its [[chemical formula|molecular formula]] is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH. An alternative notation is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−OH, which indicates that the carbon of a [[methyl group]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−) is attached to the carbon of a [[methylene group]] (−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–), which is attached to the oxygen of a [[Hydroxyl|hydroxyl group (−OH)]]. It is a constitutional [[isomer]] of [[dimethyl ether]]. Ethanol is sometimes abbreviated as '''EtOH''', using the common organic chemistry notation of representing the ethyl group (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;−) with '''Et'''.

===Physical properties===
[[File:Spiritusflamme mit spektrum.png|thumb|upright|Ethanol burning with its spectrum depicted]]
Ethanol is a volatile, colorless liquid that has a slight odor. It burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light. The physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its [[hydroxyl]] group and the shortness of its carbon chain. Ethanol's hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding, rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight, such as [[propane]].

Ethanol is slightly more refractive than water, having a [[refractive index]] of 1.36242 (at λ=589.3&amp;nbsp;nm and {{convert|18.35|C|F|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name="crc" /&gt; The [[triple point]] for ethanol is {{nowrap|150 [[Kelvin|K]]}} at a pressure of {{nowrap|4.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webanswers.com/science/what-is-the-triple-point-of-alcohol-a821b3 |publisher=Webanswers.com |title=What is the triple point of alcohol? |date=31 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514151711/http://www.webanswers.com/science/what-is-the-triple-point-of-alcohol-a821b3 |archive-date=14 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}{{SCICN|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solvent properties===
Ethanol is a versatile solvent, [[miscible]] with water and with many organic solvents, including [[acetic acid]], [[acetone]], [[benzene]], [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[chloroform]], [[diethyl ether]], [[ethylene glycol]], [[glycerol]], [[nitromethane]], [[pyridine]], and [[toluene]]. Its main use as a solvent is in making tincture of iodine,cough syrups etc.&lt;ref name="crc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; It is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as [[pentane]] and [[hexane]], and with aliphatic chlorides such as [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|trichloroethane]] and [[tetrachloroethylene]].&lt;ref name="merck"&gt;{{cite book | last = Windholz | first = Martha | name-list-style = vanc |title=The Merck index: an encyclopedia of chemicals and drugs|publisher=Merck|location=Rahway, N.J., U.S.A|year=1976|isbn=978-0-911910-26-1|edition=9th}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethanol's miscibility with water contrasts with the immiscibility of longer-chain alcohols (five or more carbon atoms), whose water miscibility decreases sharply as the number of carbons increases.&lt;ref name="m_and_b"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Robert Thornton | last2 = Boyd | first2 = Robert Neilson | name-list-style = vanc |title=Organic Chemistry| url = https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00morrrich | url-access = registration |edition=2nd|year=1972|publisher=Allyn and Bacon, inc.|isbn=978-0-205-08452-4}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miscibility of ethanol with [[alkane]]s is limited to alkanes up to [[undecane]]: mixtures with [[dodecane]] and higher alkanes show a [[miscibility gap]] below a certain temperature (about 13&amp;nbsp;°C for dodecane&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dahlmann U, Schneider GM |title=(Liquid + liquid) phase equilibria and critical curves of (ethanol + dodecane or tetradecane or hexadecane or 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane) from 0.1 MPa to 120.0 MPa|journal=J Chem Thermodyn|volume=21|pages=997–1004|year=1989|doi=10.1016/0021-9614(89)90160-2|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The miscibility gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes, and the temperature for complete miscibility increases.

Ethanol-water mixtures have less volume than the sum of their individual components at the given fractions. Mixing equal volumes of ethanol and water results in only 1.92 volumes of mixture.&lt;ref name="crc"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Lide | editor-first = D.

[[File:Ethanol-xtal-1976-3D-balls.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Hydrogen bonding in solid ethanol at −186&amp;nbsp;°C]]

Hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be [[hygroscopic]] to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air. The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds, notably [[sodium hydroxide|sodium]] and [[potassium hydroxide]]s, [[magnesium chloride]], [[calcium chloride]], [[ammonium chloride]], [[ammonium bromide]], and [[sodium bromide]].&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; [[Sodium chloride|Sodium]] and [[potassium chloride]]s are slightly soluble in ethanol.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end, it will also dissolve nonpolar substances, including most [[essential oil]]s&lt;ref name="merckoils"&gt;''Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs'', 9th ed.; monographs 6575 through 6669&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous flavoring, coloring, and medicinal agents.

The addition of even a few percent of ethanol to water sharply reduces the [[surface tension]] of water. This property partially explains the "[[tears of wine]]" phenomenon. When wine is swirled in a glass, ethanol evaporates quickly from the thin film of wine on the wall of the glass. As the wine's ethanol content decreases, its surface tension increases and the thin film "beads up" and runs down the glass in channels rather than as a smooth sheet.

===Flammability===
An ethanol–water solution will catch fire if heated above a temperature called its [[flash point]] and an ignition source is then applied to it.&lt;ref name="flash point"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nttworldwide.com/tech2212.htm |title=Flash Point and Fire Point |website=Nttworldwide.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214222420/http://www.nttworldwide.com/tech2212.htm |archive-date=14 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For 20% alcohol by mass (about 25% by volume), this will occur at about {{convert|25|°C|°F}}.

Ethanol mixtures can ignite below average room temperature. Ethanol is considered a flammable liquid (Class 3 Hazardous Material) in concentrations above 2.35% by mass (3.0% by volume; 6 [[Alcohol proof|proof]]).&lt;ref name="49 CFR 173.120"&gt;{{cite journal |title=49 CFR § 173.120 - Class 3 - Definitions. |journal=Code of Federal Regulation |volume=Title 49 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/49/173.120 |quote=a flammable liquid (Class 3) means a liquid having a flash point of not more than 60 °C (140 °F)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="49 CFR 172.101"&gt;{{cite journal |title=49 CFR § 172.101 - Purpose and use of hazardous materials table.|journal=Code of Federal Regulation |volume=Title 49 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/49/172.101 |quote= Hazardous materials descriptions and proper shipping names: Ethanol or Ethyl alcohol or Ethanol solutions or Ethyl alcohol solutions; Hazard class or Division: 3; Identification Numbers: UN1170; PG: II; Label Codes: 3;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
Ethanol is a byproduct of the [[Metabolism|metabolic process]] of yeast. As such, ethanol will be present in any yeast habitat.

==Production==
[[File:Ethanol Flasche.jpg|thumb|upright|94% denatured ethanol sold in a bottle for household use]]

Ethanol is produced both as a [[petrochemical]], through the hydration of ethylene and, via biological processes, by [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermenting]] sugars with [[yeast]].&lt;ref name="Mills-Ecklund"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mills GA, Ecklund EE |title=Alcohols as Components of Transportation Fuels|journal=[[Annual Review of Energy]]|volume=12|pages=47–80|year=1987|doi=10.1146/annurev.eg.12.110187.000403|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which process is more economical depends on prevailing prices of petroleum and grain feed stocks. In the 1970s most industrial ethanol in the United States was made as a petrochemical, but in the 1980s the United States introduced subsidies for corn-based ethanol and today it is almost all made from that source.&lt;ref name="WittcoffReuben2004"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Harold A. | last1 = Wittcoff  | first2 = Bryan G. | last2 = Reuben | first3 = Jeffery S. | last3 = Plotkin | name-list-style = vanc | title = Industrial Organic Chemicals|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4KHzc-nYPNsC|page=136}}|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-44385-8|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethylene hydration===
Ethanol for use as an industrial feedstock or solvent (sometimes referred to as synthetic ethanol) is made from [[petrochemical]] feed stocks, primarily by the [[acid]]-[[catalysis|catalyzed]] hydration of ethylene:

The catalyst is most commonly [[phosphoric acid]],&lt;ref name="r_and_c"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=John D.|last2=Caserio|first2=Marjorie C.|name-list-style=vanc|author-link1=John D.

===Fermentation===
{{Main|Ethanol fermentation}}
{{See also|Yeast in winemaking}}

Ethanol in [[alcoholic beverage]]s and fuel is produced by fermentation. Certain species of [[yeast]] (e.g., ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') [[metabolism|metabolize]] [[polysaccharide|sugar]], producing ethanol and carbon dioxide. The chemical equations below summarize the conversion:

: [[glucose|{{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}]] → 2 {{chem|CH|3|C|H|2|O}}H + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: [[sucrose|{{chem|C|12|H|22|O|11}}]] + {{chem|H|2|O}} → 4 {{chem|CH|3|C|H|2|O}}H + 4 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Fermentation is the process of culturing yeast under favorable thermal conditions to produce alcohol. This process is carried out at around {{convert|35|-|40|C|F}}. Toxicity of ethanol to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing; higher concentrations, therefore, are obtained by [[Fortified wine|fortification]] or [[distillation]]. The most ethanol-tolerant yeast strains can survive up to approximately 18% ethanol by volume.

To produce ethanol from starchy materials such as [[cereal]]s, the [[starch]] must first be converted into sugars. In brewing [[beer]], this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate, or [[malt]], which produces the [[enzyme]] [[amylase]]. When the malted grain is [[mashing|mashed]], the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars.

[[Celtic Renewables]] produces ethanol using waste that results from the production of [[whisky]], and low-grade [[Potato|potatoes]], via [[Acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation|ABE fermentation]].

====Cellulose====
{{Main|Cellulosic ethanol}}

Sugars for [[ethanol fermentation]] can be obtained from [[cellulose]]. Deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products, such as [[corncob]]s, [[straw]], and [[sawdust]], into renewable energy resources. Other agricultural residues such as sugar cane bagasse and [[energy crop]]s such as [[switchgrass]] may also be fermentable sugar sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Clines | first = Tom | name-list-style = vanc |title=Brew Better Ethanol|publisher=Popular Science Online|date=July 2006|url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/energy/6756226d360ab010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103083747/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/energy/6756226d360ab010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html|archive-date=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testing===
[[File:EthanolMIRInfraredSpectra.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Infrared reflection spectra of liquid ethanol, showing the −OH band centered near 3300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and C−H bands near 2950&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]]

[[File:Ethanol near IR spectrum.png|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Near-infrared spectrum]] of liquid ethanol]]

Breweries and [[biofuel]] plants employ two methods for measuring ethanol concentration. Infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the C−H band at 2900&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This method uses a relatively inexpensive solid-state sensor that compares the C−H band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content. The calculation makes use of the [[Beer–Lambert law]]. Alternatively, by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product, using a [[hydrometer]], the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content. This inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry.

==Purification==

===Distillation===
Ethylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanol–water mixture. For most industrial and fuel uses, the ethanol must be purified. [[Fractional distillation]] at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6% by weight (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an [[azeotrope]] with a boiling point of {{convert|78.1|C|F}}, and ''cannot'' be further purified by distillation. Addition of an entraining agent, such as [[benzene]], [[cyclohexane]], or [[heptane]], allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol, water, and the entraining agent to be formed. This lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially, leading to water-free ethanol.&lt;ref name="ullmann"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Naim | last1 = Kosaric | first2 = Zdravko | last2 = Duvnjak | first3 = Adalbert | last3 = Farkas | first4 = Hermann | last4 = Sahm | first5 = Stephanie | last5 = Bringer-Meyer | first6 = Otto | last6 = Goebel | first7 = Dieter | last7 = Mayer | name-list-style = vanc | chapter = Ethanol | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | pages = 1–72 | year = 2011 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a09_587.pub2 | isbn = 9783527306732 }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At pressures less than atmospheric pressure, the composition of the ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures, and at pressures less than 70&amp;nbsp;[[torr]] (9.333&amp;nbsp;kPa), there is no azeotrope, and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanol-water mixture. While vacuum distillation of ethanol is not presently economical, pressure-swing distillation is a topic of current research. In this technique, a reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanol-water mixture of more than 95.6% ethanol. Then, fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 95.6% azeotrope, leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Molecular sieves and desiccants===
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2015}}

Apart from distillation, ethanol may be dried by addition of a [[desiccant]], such as [[molecular sieves]], [[cellulose]], and [[cornmeal]]. The desiccants can be dried and reused.&lt;ref name="ullmann" /&gt; [[Molecular sieve]]s can be used to selectively absorb the water from the 95.6% ethanol solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id= 4iEhAQAAMAAJ}}|title=Advances in Cereal Science and Technology|last=Chemists|first=American Association of Cereal|date=1986|publisher=American Association of Cereal Chemists, Incorporated|isbn=9780913250457|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic [[zeolite]] in pellet form can be used, as well as a variety of plant-derived absorbents, including [[cornmeal]], [[straw]], and [[sawdust]]. The zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with a blast of hot [[carbon dioxide]]. Cornmeal and other plant-derived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated, but where ethanol is made from grain, they are often available at low cost. Absolute ethanol produced this way has no residual benzene, and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations.

===Membranes and reverse osmosis===
Membranes can also be used to separate ethanol and water. Membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria. Membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane distillation process. This process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as first separating step. The further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode. Vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed.

===Other techniques===
A variety of other techniques have been discussed, including the following:&lt;ref name="ullmann" /&gt;

* Salting using [[potassium carbonate]] to exploit its insolubility will cause a phase separation with ethanol and water. This offers a very small potassium carbonate impurity to the alcohol that can be removed by distillation. This method is very useful in purification of ethanol by distillation, as ethanol forms an [[azeotrope]] with water.
* Direct [[electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide]] to ethanol under ambient conditions using [[copper nanoparticle]]s on a carbon nanospike film as the catalyst;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Song | first1=Yang | last2=Peng | first2=Rui | last3=Hensley | first3=Dale K. | last4=Bonnesen | first4=Peter V. | last5=Liang | first5=Liangbo | last6=Wu | first6=Zili | last7=Meyer | first7=Harry M. | last8=Chi | first8=Miaofang | last9=Ma | first9=Cheng | last10=Sumpter | first10=Bobby G. | last11=Rondinone | first11=Adam J. | name-list-style = vanc | date=2016 | title=High-Selectivity Electrochemical Conversion of CO2 to Ethanol using a Copper Nanoparticle/N-Doped Graphene Electrode| journal=ChemistrySelect | issue=Preprint | doi=10.1002/slct.201601169 | volume=1 | pages=6055–6061| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grades of ethanol===

====Denatured alcohol====
{{Main|Denatured alcohol}}

Pure ethanol and alcoholic beverages are heavily [[Sin tax|taxed]] as psychoactive drugs, but ethanol has many uses that do not involve its consumption. To relieve the tax burden on these uses, most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent has been added to the ethanol to render it unfit to drink. These include [[bitterant|bittering agents]] such as [[denatonium benzoate]] and toxins such as [[methanol]], [[naphtha]], and [[pyridine]]. Products of this kind are called ''denatured alcohol.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.procurement.umich.edu/Contracts/Denatured_Alchohol.pdf|title=U-M Program to Reduce the Consumption of Tax-free Alcohol; Denatured Alcohol a Safer, Less Expensive Alternative|publisher=University of Michigan|access-date=29 September 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127095510/http://www.procurement.umich.edu/Contracts/Denatured_Alchohol.pdf|archive-date=27 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain (2005).

====Absolute alcohol====
Absolute or anhydrous alcohol refers to ethanol with a low water content. There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to a few parts per million (ppm) levels. If [[azeotropic distillation]] is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Raj K. |last1=Bansal |last2=Bernthsen |first2=August | name-list-style = vanc |title=A Textbook of Organic Chemistry|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1B6ijcTkD5EC|page=402}}|year=2003|publisher=New Age International Limited|isbn=978-81-224-1459-2|pages=402–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. Absolute ethanol is used as a solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol. Spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in [[ultraviolet]] and visible light, fit for use as a solvent in [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Christian | first1 = Gary D. | name-list-style = vanc | chapter = Solvents for Spectrometry | title = Analytical chemistry | date = 2004 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Hoboken, N.J. | isbn = 978-0471214724 | edition = 6th | volume = 1 | page = [https://archive.org/details/analyticalchemis00chri_0/page/473 473] | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/analyticalchemis00chri_0/page/473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure ethanol is classed as 200 [[proof (alcohol)|proof]] in the U.S., equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system.&lt;ref name="Andrews2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sudhir |last=Andrews | name-list-style = vanc |title=Textbook Of Food &amp; Bevrge Mgmt|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=HfHtaq1GWUcC&amp;|page=268}}|date=1 August 2007|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-065573-7|pages=268–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rectified spirits====
Rectified spirit, an azeotropic composition of 96% ethanol containing 4% water, is used instead of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes. Spirits of wine are about 94% ethanol (188 [[proof (alcohol)|proof]]). The impurities are different from those in 95% (190 proof) laboratory ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunkee RE, Amerine MA | title = Sugar and alcohol stabilization of yeast in sweet wine | journal = Applied Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = 1067–75 | date = July 1968 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.16.7.1067-1075.1968 | pmid = 5664123 | pmc = 547590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
{{Details|Alcohol}}

Ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol, meaning that the carbon that its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well. Many ethanol reactions occur at its [[hydroxyl]] group.

===Ester formation===
In the presence of acid catalysts, ethanol reacts with [[carboxylic acid]]s to produce ethyl [[ester]]s and water:
:[[carboxylic acid|RCOOH]] + HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → [[ester|RCOOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
This reaction, which is conducted on large scale industrially, requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed. Esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt. This reaction is known as [[saponification]] because it is used in the preparation of soap. Ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids. [[Diethyl sulfate]] and [[triethyl phosphate]] are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and [[phosphorus pentoxide]] respectively. [[Diethyl sulfate]] is a useful ethylating agent in [[organic synthesis]]. [[Ethyl nitrite]], prepared from the reaction of ethanol with [[sodium nitrite]] and sulfuric acid, was formerly used as a [[diuretic]].

===Dehydration===
In the presence of acid catalysts, ethanol converts to [[ethylene]].  Typically [[solid acid]]s such as silica are used:&lt;ref name=UllmannEthylene&gt;{{cite book |first1=Heinz |last1=Zimmermann |first2=Roland |last2=Walz |chapter=Ethylene |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_045.pub3|isbn=978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH  →  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Ethylene produced in this way competes with ethylene from oil refineries and fracking.

Under alternative conditions, [[diethyl ether]] results:
:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH  → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Combustion===
Complete [[combustion]] of ethanol forms [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH (l) + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l); −ΔH&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 1371&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heats of Formation of Simple Organic Molecules | last = Rossini | first = Frederick D. | name-list-style = vanc  |journal=Ind.

:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH (l) + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (g); −ΔH&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 1236&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol = 26.8&amp;nbsp;kJ/g = 295.4&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol = 6.41 kcal/g&lt;ref&gt;Calculated from heats of formation from CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968–1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific heat = 2.44 kJ/(kg·K)

===Acid-base chemistry===
Ethanol is a neutral molecule and the [[pH]] of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly 7.00. Ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its [[conjugate base]], the [[Alkoxide|ethoxide]] ion (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), by reaction with an [[alkali metal]] such as [[sodium]]:&lt;ref name="m_and_b" /&gt;
:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH + 2 Na → 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONa + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
or a very strong base such as [[sodium hydride]]:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH + NaH → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONa + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The acidities of water and ethanol are nearly the same, as indicated by their [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] of 15.7 and 16 respectively. Thus, sodium ethoxide and [[sodium hydroxide]] exist in an equilibrium that is closely balanced:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH + NaOH {{eqm}} CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONa + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Halogenation===
Ethanol is not used industrially as a precursor to ethyl halides, but the reactions are illustrative. Ethanol reacts with [[hydrogen halide]]s to produce [[haloalkane|ethyl halides]] such as [[ethyl chloride]] and [[ethyl bromide]] via an [[SN2 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction]]:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH + [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]] → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
These reactions require a catalyst such as [[zinc chloride]].&lt;ref name="s_and_h"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Andrew | last1 = Streitwieser | first2 = Clayton H. | last2 = Heathcock | name-list-style = vanc | author-link1 = Andrew Streitwieser | author-link2 = Clayton Heathcock | title = Introduction to Organic Chemistry| url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontoor00stre | url-access = registration |year=1976|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=978-0-02-418010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
HBr requires [[refluxing]] with a [[sulfuric acid]] catalyst.&lt;ref name="s_and_h" /&gt; Ethyl halides can, in principle, also be produced by treating ethanol with more specialized [[Halogenation|halogenating agents]], such as [[thionyl chloride]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]].&lt;ref name="m_and_b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="s_and_h" /&gt;
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH + SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl

Upon treatment with halogens in the presence of base, ethanol gives the corresponding [[haloform]] (CHX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where X = Cl, Br, I). This conversion is called the [[haloform reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Chakrabartty SK | veditors = Trahanovsky WS | title = Oxidation in Organic Chemistry | pages = 343–370 | publisher = Academic Press | location = New York | year = 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "
An intermediate in the reaction with chlorine is the [[aldehyde]] called [[chloral]], which forms [[chloral hydrate]] upon reaction with water:&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Reinhard | first1 = Jira | first2 = Erwin | last2 = Kopp | first3 = Blaine C. | last3 = McKusick | first4 = Gerhard | last4 = Röderer | first5 = Axel | last5 = Bosch | first6 = Gerald | last6 = Fleischmann | name-list-style = vanc | chapter = Chloroacetaldehydes | title =  Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a06_527.pub2 | isbn = 978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:4 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH → CCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO + 5 HCl
:CCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H

===Oxidation===
Ethanol can be oxidized to [[acetaldehyde]] and further oxidized to [[acetic acid]], depending on the reagents and conditions.&lt;ref name="s_and_h" /&gt; This oxidation is of no importance industrially, but in the human body, these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the [[enzyme]] [[liver alcohol dehydrogenase]]. The oxidation product of ethanol, acetic acid, is a nutrient for humans, being a precursor to [[acetyl CoA]], where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis.

==History==
{{Details|Distilled beverage}}&lt;!--
[[File:Alcohol flame.jpg|thumb|upright|Ethanol being used as fuel for a burner]]--&gt;

The [[ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] of sugar into ethanol is one of the earliest [[biotechnology|biotechnologies]] employed by humans. Ethanol has historically been identified variously as spirit of wine or ardent spirits,&lt;ref&gt;William Campbell Ottley, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wYcwvwyk2RAC A Dictionary of Chemistry, and of Minerology]'' (1826) see entry "Alcohol"&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[aqua vitae]] or aqua vita. The intoxicating effects of its consumption have been known since ancient times. Ethanol has been used by humans since prehistory as the intoxicating ingredient of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Dried residue on 9,000-year-old pottery found in China suggests that [[Neolithic]] people consumed alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref name="Roach"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roach J |date=18 July 2005|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0718_050718_ancientbeer.html|title=9,000-Year-Old Beer Re-Created From Chinese Recipe|journal=National Geographic News|access-date=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|medieval Muslims]] used the [[distillation]] process extensively, and applied it to the [[Distilled beverage|distillation of alcohol]]. The Arab chemist [[Al-Kindi]] unambiguously described the distillation of wine in the 9th century.&lt;ref name="hassan"&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Ahmad Y. al-Hassan | vauthors = al-Hassan AY | year = 2001 | url =  {{google books |plainurl=y |id=h2g1qte4iegC|page=65}} | title = Science and Technology in Islam: Technology and applied sciences | pages = 65–69 | publisher = [[UNESCO]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hassan-Alcohol&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/notes/notes7.html |title=Alcohol and the Distillation of Wine in Arabic Sources |access-date=19 April 2014 |last=Hassan |first=Ahmad Y | name-list-style = vanc | author-link = Ahmad Y Hassan |website=History of Science and Technology in Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.economist.com/node/2281757 | journal = The Economist | title = Liquid fire – The Arabs discovered how to distil alcohol.

The process later spread from the [[Middle East]] to Italy.&lt;ref name="hassan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="habib"/&gt; Production of alcohol from distilled wine was later recorded by the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|School of Salerno]] alchemists in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite book | last = Forbes | first = Robert James | name-list-style = vanc | year = 1948 | title = A short history of the art of distillation | publisher = Brill | page = 89 | isbn = 978-9004006171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mention of absolute alcohol, in contrast with alcohol-water mixtures, was later made by [[Ramon Llull|Raymond Lull]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

In [[China]], archaeological evidence indicates that the true distillation of alcohol began during the 12th century [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] or [[Southern Song dynasty|Southern Song]] dynasties.&lt;ref name=haw&gt;{{cite book | last= Haw | first= Stephen G. | name-list-style = vanc | author-link= Stephen G.

In 1796, German-Russian chemist Johann Tobias Lowitz obtained pure ethanol by mixing partially purified ethanol (the alcohol-water azeotrope) with an excess of anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture over low heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowitz |first=T. | name-list-style = vanc |journal=Chemische Annalen für die Freunde der Naturlehre, Aerznengelartheit, Haushaltungskunde und Manufakturen|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Zws_AAAAcAAJ}}|year=1796|title=Anzeige eines, zur volkommen Entwasserung des Weingeistes nothwendig zu beobachtenden, Handgriffs | language = de | trans-title = Report of a task that must be done for the complete dehydration of wine spirits [i.e., alcohol-water azeotrope]) |volume= 1 |pp= 195–204 | quote = See pp. 197–198: Lowitz dehydrated the azeotrope by mixing it with a 2:1 excess of anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture over low heat.}}&lt;/ref&gt; French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] described ethanol as a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and in 1807 [[Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure]] determined ethanol's chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle = Alcohol|volume=1|pages=525–527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Saussure |first=Théodore | name-list-style = vanc |journal=Journal de Physique, de Chimie, d'Histoire Naturelle et des Arts | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=G-UPAAAAQAAJ|page=316}} |year=1807|title=Mémoire sur la composition de l'alcohol et de l'éther sulfurique |volume= 64 |pp= 316–354}} In his 1807 paper, Saussure determined ethanol's composition only roughly; a more accurate analysis of ethanol appears on page 300 of his 1814 paper: {{cite journal|last=de Saussure |first=Théodore|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ch8zAQAAMAAJ|page=273}}|year=1814|pages=273–305|title=Nouvelles observations sur la composition de l'alcool et de l'éther sulfurique|volume=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, [[Archibald Scott Couper]] published the structural formula of ethanol.

Ethanol was first prepared synthetically in 1825 by [[Michael Faraday]]. He found that sulfuric acid could absorb large volumes of [[coal gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faraday M | year = 1825 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k559209/f473.image | title = On new compounds of carbon and hydrogen, and on certain other products obtained during the decomposition of oil by heat | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 115 | pages = 440–466 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1825.0022| doi-access = free }} In a footnote on page 448, Faraday notes the action of sulfuric acid on coal gas and coal-gas distillate; specifically, "The [sulfuric] acid combines directly with carbon and hydrogen; and I find when [the resulting compound is] united with bases [it] forms a peculiar class of salts, somewhat resembling the sulphovinates [i.e., ethyl sulfates], but still different from them."&lt;/ref&gt; He gave the resulting solution to [[Henry Hennell]], a British chemist, who found in 1826 that it contained "sulphovinic acid" ([[Ethyl sulfate|ethyl hydrogen sulfate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hennell H |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=f05FAAAAcAAJ|page=}}|year=1826|title=On the mutual action of sulphuric acid and alcohol, with observations on the composition and properties of the resulting compound|volume= 116 | pages = 240–249 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1826.0021|s2cid=98278290}} On page 248, Hennell mentions that Faraday gave him some sulfuric acid in which coal gas had dissolved and that he (Hennell) found that it contained "sulphovinic acid" (ethyl hydrogen sulfate).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, Hennell and the French chemist [[Georges-Simon Serullas]] independently discovered that sulphovinic acid could be decomposed into ethanol.&lt;ref name="Hennell"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hennell H  | year = 1828 | title = On the mutual action of sulfuric acid and alcohol, and on the nature of the process by which ether is formed|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=118|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=X-9FAAAAMAAJ|page=365}}|doi=10.1098/rstl.1828.0021|pages=365–371| s2cid = 98483646 }} On page 368, Hennell produces ethanol from "sulfovinic acid" ([[Ethyl sulfate|ethyl hydrogen sulfate]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sérullas |first=Georges-Simon|editor-first1=Louis-Bernard |editor-last1=Guyton de Morveau|editor-first2=Joseph Louis |editor-last2=Gay-Lussac|editor-first3=François |editor-last3=Arago|editor4=Michel Eugène Chevreul|editor5= Marcellin Berthelot|editor6= Éleuthère Élie Nicolas Mascart|editor7= Albin Haller| name-list-style = vanc |journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ZxUAAAAAMAAJ|page=152}}|year=1828|title=De l'action de l'acide sulfurique sur l'alcool, et des produits qui en résultent|volume=39 |pp=152–186}} On page 158, Sérullas mentions the production of alcohol from "sulfate acid d'hydrogène carboné" (hydrocarbon acid sulfate).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 1825 Faraday had unwittingly discovered that ethanol could be produced from [[ethylene]] (a component of coal gas) by [[Acid catalysis|acid-catalyzed]] hydration, a process similar to current industrial ethanol synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;In 1855, the French chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]] confirmed Faraday's discovery by preparing ethanol from pure ethylene. {{cite journal|first=Marcellin |last=Berthelot|editor-first1=François |editor-last1=Arago|editor-first2=Joseph Louis |editor-last2=Gay-Lussac| name-list-style = vanc |journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1ClCAAAAcAAJ|page=385}}|year=1855|title=Sur la formation de l'alcool au moyen du bicarbure d'hydrogène (On the formation of alcohol by means of ethylene) |volume= 43 |pp=385–405}} (Note: The chemical formulas in Berthelot's paper are wrong because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic masses for the elements; e.g., carbon (6 instead of 12), oxygen (8 instead of 16), etc.)&lt;/ref&gt;

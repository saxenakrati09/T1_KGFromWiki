'''Tesla, Inc.''' is an American [[electric vehicle]] and [[clean energy]] company based in [[Palo Alto, California]]. Tesla's current products include [[electric car]]s, battery [[energy storage]] from home to grid scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, as well as other related products and services.

Founded in July 2003 as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer [[Nikola Tesla]]. [[Elon Musk]], who contributed most of the funding in the early days, has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power.&lt;ref name="MasterPlan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Revisiting "The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)" |url=https://insideevs.com/news/318223/revisiting-the-secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me/ |access-date=August 31, 2020 |website=InsideEVs |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling [[Plug-in electric vehicle|plug-in]] and [[Battery electric vehicle|battery electric]] passenger car manufacturer in 2019, with a market share of 17% of the plug-in segment and 23% of the battery electric segment.

The batteries are placed under the vehicle floor. This saves interior and trunk (boot) space but increases the risk of battery damage by debris or impact (see [[#Crashes and fires]]). After two vehicle fires in 2013 due to road debris, the Model S was retrofitted with a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to reduce the possibility of damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Prince|first=Max|date=March 28, 2014|title=Meet the up-armored, titanium-shielded Tesla Model S|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/go/news/tesla-model-s-titanium-underbody-shield|access-date=October 6, 2020|website=Road &amp; Track|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|AutoPilot}}Autopilot ===
[[File:Tesla Autopilot Engaged in Model X.jpg|thumb|Tesla Autopilot in operation]]
{{Main|Tesla Autopilot}}
Autopilot is an [[advanced driver-assistance system]] developed by Tesla. Tesla states that Autopilot is "designed to assist drivers with the most burdensome parts of driving" in order to make Tesla cars "safer and more capable over time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Tesla states that current ({{As of|2020|07|lc=y}}) Autopilot features require active driver supervision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple engineer killed in Tesla SUV crash on Silicon Valley freeway was playing videogame: NTSB|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-engineer-killed-in-tesla-suv-crash-on-silicon-valley-freeway-was-playing-videogame-ntsb-2020-02-25|access-date=April 29, 2020|website=Market Watch|publisher=Market Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not make the vehicle autonomous.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Starting in September 2014, all Tesla cars are shipped with sensors and software to support Autopilot (initially hardware version 1 or "HW1").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lambert|first=Fred|date=June 17, 2015|title=Understanding Tesla's self-driving features: The Autopilot|url=https://electrek.co/2015/06/16/understanding-teslas-self-driving-features-the-autopilot/|access-date=July 7, 2020|website=Electrek|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla upgraded its sensors and software in October 2016 ("HW2") to support full self-driving in the future.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lambert|first=Fred|date=October 20, 2016|title=A look at Tesla's new Autopilot hardware suite: 8 cameras, 1 radar, ultrasonics &amp; new supercomputer|url=https://electrek.co/2016/10/20/tesla-new-autopilot-hardware-suite-camera-nvidia-tesla-vision/|access-date=July 7, 2020|website=Electrek|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; HW2 includes eight cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tesla.com/autopilot/?utm |title=Autopilot: Full Self-Driving Hardware on All Cars |publisher=Tesla Motors|website=tesla.com |access-date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; HW2.5 was released in mid-2017, and it upgraded HW2 with a second [[Graphics processing unit|graphics process unit (GPU)]] and, for the Model 3 only, a driver-facing camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://electrek.co/2017/08/09/tesla-autopilot-2-5-hardware-computer-autonomous-driving/ |title=Tesla has a new Autopilot '2.5' hardware suite with more computing power for autonomous driving |last=Lambert |first=Fred |date=August 9, 2017 |work=Electrek|access-date=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HW3 was released in early 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla starts Hardware 3 rollout: Enhanced Summon, red-light warnings|url=https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1122267_tesla-starts-hardware-3-rollout-enhanced-summon-red-light-warnings|access-date=July 7, 2020|website=Green Car Reports|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2019, Tesla announced that all of its cars will include Autopilot software (defined as just ''Traffic-Aware Cruise Control'' and ''Autosteer'' (Beta)) as a standard feature moving forward.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/autopilot|title=Autopilot|website=tesla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot|title=Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability|date=February 13, 2019|website=tesla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full self-driving software ([[Automatic parking|Autopark]], Navigate on Autopilot (Beta), Auto Lane Change (Beta), [[Tesla Autopilot#Summon (Beta)|Summon (Beta)]], [[Tesla Autopilot#Smart Summon (Beta)|Smart Summon (Beta)]] and future abilities) is an extra cost option.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On April 24, 2020, Tesla released a software update to Autopilot. With this update, cars recognize and automatically stop at stop signs. The cars also automatically slow down and eventually stop at traffic lights (even if they are green), and the driver indicates that it is safe to proceed through the traffic light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Teslas can now see and slow for traffic lights and stop signs|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238637/tesla-cars-traffic-light-stop-sign-control-feature-self-driving|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=April 27, 2020|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=May 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla acknowledges that the software is still in a [[beta test]] phase and far from being finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McFarland |first1=Matt |title=Tesla's latest Autopilot feature is slowing down for green lights, too |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/tech/tesla-autopilot-stoplight/index.html |website=CNN |publisher=CNN |access-date=April 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musk initially said in 2017 that Semi deliveries would start in 2019 and be selling 100,000 trucks a year, but deliveries were later delayed to 2021.

In 2016, Tesla recommended to have any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: "your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes," and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dent|first=Steve|date=March 22, 2019|title=Tesla drops annual servicing for 'as needed' repair model|work=Engadget|location=US|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/22/tesla-annual-servicing-now-as-needed/|access-date=August 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2017, the [[American Automobile Association]] raised insurance rates for Tesla owners following a report from the [[Highway Loss Data Institute]]. The report concluded that the Model S crashes 46% more often and is 50% more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles. Similarly, the Model X was concluded to crash 41% more often and to be 89% more expensive to repair than similar vehicles. As a result, AAA raised insurance rates on Tesla cars by 30%. Tesla said that the analysis is "severely flawed and not reflective of reality", however, Tesla failed to provide any contradictory numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/aaa-raising-insurance-costs-for-tesla-owners-96345.html |title=AAA raising insurance rates for Tesla owners |last=Glon |first=Ronan |date=June 4, 2017 |publisher=Left Lane News |access-date=June 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Russ Rader, the spokesman for the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]], confirmed the AAA's analysis and that "Teslas get into a lot of crashes and are costly to repair afterward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20170604/FINANCE_AND_INSURANCE/170609884/-tesla-owners-should-pay-more-for-insurance-aaa-says |title=Tesla owners should pay more for insurance, AAA says |last=Burke |first=Katie |date=June 4, 2017 |newspaper=Automotive News |access-date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://jalopnik.com/aaa-raises-insurance-rates-on-tesla-vehicles-1795814904 |title=AAA Raises Insurance Rates On Tesla Vehicles Because Repairs Are So Costly |last=Felton |first=Ryan |website=[[Jalopnik]] |date=June 5, 2017|access-date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, an analysis of claim frequency and insurance cost data by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety conducted by financial research provider 24/7 Wall St. found that the Tesla Model S and Model X were the two most expensive vehicles to insure.&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt; Musk hopes that these insurance rates will greatly decrease once driver-assist and self-driving technology become commonplace.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barlyn|first1=Suzanne|last2=Mathias|first2=Tamara|date=August 28, 2019|title=Tesla rolls out insurance in California|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-markel-insurance/tesla-rolls-out-insurance-in-california-idUSKCN1VI2QZ|work=Reuters|access-date=November 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawsuits and controversies ==
{{Main|List of lawsuits and controversies of Tesla, Inc.}}

=== Ongoing lawsuits ===
According to the legal advocacy website [[PlainSite]], Tesla has been party to 620 lawsuits as of June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Klippenstein|first=Matthew|title=Tesla Enters "Whistleblower Hell"|url=https://www.thedrive.com/tech/29089/tesla-enters-whistleblower-hell|access-date=June 10, 2020|website=The Drive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing cases include Musk's "Funding secured" tweet, CEO performance award, the acquisition of SolarCity, and allegations of [[whistleblower]] retaliation.

Some of Tesla's major legal problems regards a statement from CEO Elon Musk. On August 7, 2018, Musk tweeted, "Am considering taking Tesla private at $420.

In 2018 a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.&lt;ref name="SEC file" /&gt; Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million, in May 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kolodny|first=Lauren Feiner, Lora|date=May 28, 2020|title=Elon Musk earns first performance-based payout from Tesla, worth more than $700 million|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/28/musk-gets-first-tranche-of-multimillion-dollar-tesla-incentive-payout.html|access-date=July 19, 2020|website=CNBC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other legal cases involve the acquisition of SolarCity.

=== Controversies ===
Outside of the courts, Tesla has been the subject of other public controversies, ranging from accounting issues to workers' safety complaints. [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] ranked Tesla number 14 on their "Evil List" of most dangerous tech companies in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=January 15, 2020|title=Which Tech Company Is Really the Most Evil?|url=https://slate.com/technology/2020/01/evil-list-tech-companies-dangerous-amazon-facebook-google-palantir.html|access-date=August 21, 2020|website=Slate Magazine|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Battery swap technology ====
From 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Richards|first=Tori|date=July 23, 2015|title=Tesla got $295M in subsidies for technology it didn't offer|url=https://www.watchdog.org/california/tesla-got-m-in-subsidies-for-technology-it-didn-t/article_16c9814c-8176-5a03-a595-8cf0e2119455.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010015457/https://www.watchdog.org/california/tesla-got-m-in-subsidies-for-technology-it-didn-t/article_16c9814c-8176-5a03-a595-8cf0e2119455.html|archive-date=October 10, 2018|website=Watchdog.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=December 22, 2013|title=The Tesla battery swap is the hoax of the year|url=https://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/12/21/the-tesla-battery-swap-is-the-hoax-of-the-year/|access-date=December 3, 2020|website=Watts Up With That?|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla's Smoke &amp; Mirrors Battery Swap Scam - Autoline Daily Insight - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9zpOjOZgbk|access-date=December 3, 2020|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff at [[California Air Resources Board]] were concerned that Tesla was "gaming" the battery swap subsidies and recommended eliminating the credits in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Niedermeyer|first=Edward|date=June 23, 2015|title=Tesla Battery Swap: CARB's Bridge To Nowhere|url=https://dailykanban.com/2015/06/tesla-battery-swap-carbs-bridge-to-nowhere/|access-date=May 18, 2020|website=DailyKanban|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9zpOjOZgbk|access-date=May 18, 2020|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== COVID-19 pandemic in the United States ====
Much controversy surrounds Tesla's management of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]]. At the onset of and during the pandemic, CEO Elon Musk repeatedly downplayed its risks. Later in May 2020, while [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production at the factory on the 11th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Aarian |title=Elon Musk Defies Lockdown Orders and Reopens Tesla's Factory |url=https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-defies-lockdown-orders-reopens-tesla-factory/ |website=Wired |access-date=June 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was in non-compliance with the [[Governor of California|governor]]'s order for the state of California during the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=May 13, 2020|title=The dispute over reopening the Tesla factory may be over|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-05-13/dispute-over-reopening-tesla-factory-may-be-over|access-date=June 14, 2020|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Boudette|first=Neal E.|date=May 8, 2020|title=Tesla Tells Workers It Will Reopen California Factory Despite County Order|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/business/economy/tesla-coronavirus-factory-alameda.html|access-date=June 14, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla also filed a lawsuit against Alameda County but later rescinded it after the Fremont factory was given approval to reopen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=May 21, 2020|title=Tesla drops lawsuit against Alameda County after Fremont factory reopens|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Tesla-drops-lawsuit-against-Alameda-County-after-15284242.php|access-date=June 14, 2020|website=SFChronicle.com|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnbc20200613"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kolodny|first=Jessica Bursztynsky, Lora|date=May 20, 2020|title=Tesla drops lawsuit against California's Alameda County over coronavirus restrictions|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/tesla-drops-suit-against-californias-alameda-county.html|access-date=June 13, 2020|website=CNBC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla published its detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kolodny|first=Emma Newburger, Lora|date=May 10, 2020|title=Tesla says it will resume operations.

==== Environmental violations ====
Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont factory increased dramatically from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Niedermeyer|first=Edward|date=June 3, 2019|title=Documents Show Persistent Air Quality Non-Compliance At Tesla Factory|url=https://www.thedrive.com/tech/28338/documents-show-persistent-air-quality-non-compliance-at-tesla-factory|access-date=May 18, 2020|website=The Drive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the [[Bay Area Air Quality Management District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Niedermeyer|first=Edward|title=Tesla In Settlement Proceedings Over 19 Air Quality Violations As Investigation Continues|url=https://www.thedrive.com/tech/28413/tesla-in-settlement-proceedings-over-19-air-quality-violations-as-investigation-continues|access-date=May 18, 2020|website=The Drive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violations centered on Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there have been frequent fires since 2014.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Niedermeyer|first=Edward|title=Tesla Air Quality Compliance Violations Center On Troubled Paint Shop|url=https://www.thedrive.com/tech/28339/tesla-air-quality-compliance-violations-center-on-troubled-paint-shop|access-date=May 18, 2020|website=The Drive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also investigated Tesla for violations of the Clean Air Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Niedermeyer|first=Edward|title=EPA Join Local Authorities In Evaluating Clean Air Act Compliance At Tesla Factory|url=https://www.thedrive.com/tech/28667/epa-join-local-authorities-in-evaluating-clean-air-act-compliance-at-tesla-factory|access-date=May 18, 2020|website=The Drive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations in April 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=April 1, 2019|title=Tesla penalized for violating hazardous waste law at California factory|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/1/18291091/tesla-epa-fine-hazardous-waste-fremont-factory|access-date=May 18, 2020|website=The Verge|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flawed battery design and fires ====
In June 2012, Tesla knew the battery cooling system in its Model S cars had a flawed design that made it susceptible to leaks, which could short the battery or cause a fire.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lopez|first=Linette|title=Tesla knew its Model S battery had a design flaw that could lead to leaks and, ultimately, fires starting in 2012.

In October 2019, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) began investigating Tesla's Model S and X vehicles for potential battery defects that could cause "non-crash" fires.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Blanco|first=Sebastian|date=November 1, 2019|title=NHTSA, Investigating Tesla Fire Reports, Demands Data on Battery Software Changes|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29666731/nhtsa-investigation-tesla-fire-reports/|access-date=June 24, 2020|website=Car and Driver|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Giga New York ====
Tesla's [[Giga New York]] factory, which was built and equipped using nearly $1 billion in New York taxpayer money, has faced criticism and legal actions regarding allegations of inflated job promises, cost overruns, construction delays, [[bid rigging]], a perceived lack of effort from Musk, and claims that the deal was, in effect, a bailout of Musk's cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/06/22/musk-calls-teslas-solarcity-deal-no-brainer-investors-disagree/86249516/ |title=Musk calls Tesla's SolarCity deal 'no-brainer'; investors disagree|work=USA TODAY|access-date=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://buffalonews.com/2019/07/24/teslas-solar-energy-business-takes-a-turn-for-the-worse/ |title=Tesla's solar energy business takes a turn for the worse |last=Robinson |first=David |date=July 24, 2019|work=The Buffalo News |access-date=July 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-11-20/inside-elon-musk-s-forgotten-gigafactory-2-in-buffalo |title=Inside Elon Musk's forgotten Gigafactory in Buffalo |last1=Carr |first1=Austin |last2=Eckhouse |first2=Brian |website=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=November 20, 2018 |access-date=July 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=April 30, 2020|title=Tesla will seek one-year break on job commitments|url=https://www.wivb.com/news/tesla-will-seek-one-year-break-on-job-commitments/|access-date=August 19, 2020|website=News 4 Buffalo|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York state comptroller released a "scathing" audit of the project, concluding that it presented many red flags, lacked basic due diligence, and produced only 54 cents in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state (compared to the benchmark set for these types of projects of $30 in economic benefits for every $1 spent).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=August 21, 2020|title=Scathing audit of high-tech projects slams ESD for lack of due diligence on Tesla at RiverBend|url=https://www.wivb.com/news/local-news/buffalo/scathing-audit-of-high-tech-projects-slams-esd-for-lack-of-due-diligence-on-tesla-at-riverbend/|access-date=August 21, 2020|website=News 4 Buffalo|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Short sellers ====
As of January 15, 2020, Tesla stock was the most-[[Short (finance)|shorted]] in U.S. equity markets. Over 20% of its stock was shorted at that time, with many shorters losing large amounts of money as the stock price climbed much higher later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796328145/electric-burn-those-who-bet-against-elon-musk-and-tesla-are-paying-a-big-price|title=Electric Burn: Those Who Bet Against Elon Musk And Tesla Are Paying A Big Price|website=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TSLAQ]] is an informal and largely anonymous group of Tesla shorters and critics, mainly organized online.

==== Worker safety and rights ====
According to former employees at Tesla's Fremont factory, Tesla has systematically denied medical care to injured workers, forced injured workers to return to the production line without relief, and insisted that seriously injured workers be sent to the emergency room in a [[Lyft]] rather than call 911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Inside Tesla's factory, a medical clinic designed to ignore injured workers|url=https://www.revealnews.org/article/inside-teslas-factory-a-medical-clinic-designed-to-ignore-injured-workers/|website=Reveal|language=en|access-date=May 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by [[Reveal (podcast)|Reveal]] found that Tesla "failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports, making the company's injury numbers look better than they actually are."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla says its factory is safer.

On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and "prevent the vehicles from moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tesla's real problem isn't that its cars are expensive.

On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to [[corrosion]]-susceptible [[power steering]] bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use "increased force" to control the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/29/tesla-recalls-123000-model-s-cars-over-potential-power-steering-failure-reports.html |title=Tesla voluntarily recalls 123,000 Model S cars over faulty steering component |last=Wang |first=Christine |date=March 29, 2018 |work=CNBC|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] announced that it was reviewing reports of suspension problems in Tesla Model S sedans.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|date=June 9, 2016|title=U.S. reviewing suspension complaints in Tesla Model S cars|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-safety-idUSKCN0YV2DL|access-date=July 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHTSA also said they were aware that Tesla had entered into a "troublesome" non-disclosure agreement with one Model S owner regarding the suspension issue.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Niedermeyer|first=Edward|date=June 8, 2016|title=Tesla Suspension Breakage: It's Not The Crime, It's The Coverup|url=https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/|access-date=July 6, 2020|website=DailyKanban|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist and [[Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors|author]] Ed Niedermeyer called this type of agreement "unheard of in the auto industry", and noted that a policy of demanding non-disclosure agreements for "goodwill" repairs would limit the number of defects Tesla owners reported to the NHTSA.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Cases of the "whompy wheel" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lopez|first=Linette|title='Aladdin' star says a defect in his Tesla Model 3 led to his car wreck, and it comes from a problem area the company has known about for years|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/aladdin-stars-problem-with-tesla-known-as-whompy-wheels-2019-6|access-date=October 26, 2020|website=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been documented through 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Skwarczek|first=Matthew|date=May 28, 2020|title=Tesla Owners Shouldn't Be OK With Their Cars' Quality Issues|url=https://www.motorbiscuit.com/tesla-owners-shouldnt-be-ok-with-their-cars-quality-issues/|access-date=October 26, 2020|website=MotorBiscuit|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kolodny|first=Lora|date=October 23, 2020|title=Tesla recalls nearly 50,000 Model S and X cars in China over faulty suspension|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/tesla-recalls-model-s/x-cars-in-china-over-faulty-suspension.html|access-date=October 26, 2020|website=CNBC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November the NHTSA announced it had "opened an investigation into about 115,0000 Tesla vehicles over front suspension safety issues," citing 2015 - 2017 Model S and 2016 - 2017 Model X vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=November 27, 2020|title=U.S. agency opens probe into 115,000 Tesla vehicles over suspension issue|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/us-agency-opens-probe-into-115000-tesla-vehicles-over-suspension-issue.html|access-date=December 9, 2020|website=CNBC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crashes and fires ===
{{See also|Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents#Tesla|Tesla Autopilot#Serious crashes}}
Tesla vehicles have been involved in a number of controversial fires and crashes. Some of these crashes involve the use of the Autopilot driver assistance system.

In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in [[Kent, Washington]]. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/highway-fire-of-tesla-model-s-included-its-lithium-battery/ |title=Tesla Says Car Fire Started in Battery |first=Christopher |last=Jensen |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 2, 2013 |access-date=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1088588_tesla-fires-nhtsa-will-probe-warranty-to-cover-fire-damage-ride-height-tweak |title=Tesla Fires: NHTSA Will Probe, Warranty To Cover Fire Damage, Ride-Height Tweak |first=John |last=Voelcker |website=Green Car Reports |date=November 19, 2013 |access-date=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 28, 2014, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after the automaker said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/business/safety-agency-ends-investigation-of-tesla-fires.html |title=Federal Safety Agency Ends Its Investigation of Tesla Fires |first=Danielle |last=Ivory |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 28, 2014 |access-date=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the {{convert|0.25|inch|adj=on}} aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=George |first=Patrick |title=The Tesla Model S: Now With Road Debris-Crushing Titanium! |url=http://jalopnik.com/the-tesla-model-s-now-with-road-debris-crushing-titani-1553544362 |website=[[Jalopnik]] |access-date=March 31, 2014 |date=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode. The driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/business/self-driving-tesla-fatal-crash-investigation.html |title=Self-Driving Tesla Was Involved in Fatal Crash, U.S. Says |first1=Bill |last1=Vlasic |first2=Neal E. |last2=Boudette |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 30, 2016 |access-date=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/HWY16FH018-preliminary.aspx |title=Preliminary Report, Highway HWY16FH018 |publisher=[[NTSB]] |date=July 26, 2016 |access-date=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/01/probing-teslas-deadly-crash-feds-say-yay-self-driving/ |title=After Probing Tesla's Deadly Crash, Feds Say Yay to Self-Driving |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |location=US |first=Jack |last=Steware |date=January 20, 2017 |access-date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, an Apple engineer was killed in a crash in a Tesla Model X. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in ‘self-driving’ mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple engineer killed in Tesla SUV crash on Silicon Valley freeway was playing videogame: NTSB |url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-engineer-killed-in-tesla-suv-crash-on-silicon-valley-freeway-was-playing-videogame-ntsb-2020-02-25 |website=Market Watch |publisher=Market Watch |access-date=April 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Delays ===
Tesla has been criticized for repeatedly over-promising and under-delivering. Delivery dates for new vehicles and new vehicle features slipped on the Roadster, Model S, Model X and Model 3. Advanced technologies like the prospect of a large network of [[solar-power]]ed supercharger stations (first installation was in 2012; only a few were solar-powered as of mid 2019)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2019/07/18/tesla-v3-supercharger-station-las-vegas-solar-power-battery/|title=Tesla opens new V3 Supercharger with solar and battery - looks like EV charging station of the future|last=Lambert|first=Fred|date=July 18, 2019|website=Electrek|language=en-US|access-date=February 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; also lagged projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lavrinc |first1=Damon |title=What Will Tesla And Elon Musk Over Promise Next? |url=http://jalopnik.com/what-will-tesla-and-elon-musk-over-promise-next-1672402636 |access-date=December 18, 2014 |website=[[Jalopnik]] |date=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early October 2017, Musk had predicted that Model 3 production would be up to 5,000 units per week by December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/10/02/we-understand-what-needs-to-be-fixed-tesla-says-after-bungling-model-3-production-goals/ |title='We understand what needs to be fixed,' Tesla says after missing Model 3 production goals |first=Peter |last=Holley |date=October 2, 2017 |access-date=November 5, 2017 |via=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, he revised that target to "sometime in March" 2018 due in part to difficulties with robots on the assembly line, but primarily due to problems with the battery module.&lt;ref name="WP_production-hell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/11/03/sleepless-nights-broken-robots-and-mounting-pressure-musk-offers-rare-glimpse-inside-teslas-production-hell |title=Analysis – Sleepless nights, broken robots and mounting pressure: Musk offers rare glimpse inside Tesla's 'production hell'|last=Holley|first=Peter |date=November 3, 2017 |website=WashingtonPost.com |access-date=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analyst with Cowan and Company, a public relations firm, made this comment: "Elon Musk needs to stop over promising and under delivering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-results-reaction/tesla-must-stop-overpromising-could-need-more-finance-analysts-idUSKBN1D21A3 |title=Tesla must stop overpromising, could need more finance: analysts |date=November 2, 2017 |access-date=November 6, 2017 |via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2018, Musk revealed on [[Twitter]] that Tesla will be building its own car carriers as the company is facing challenges due to logistics. Tesla is running into an acute shortage of car carrier trailers leading to a delay in the delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-musk/tesla-is-making-its-own-car-carriers-idUSKCN1M42HG?il=0 |title=Tesla is making its own car carriers |work=Reuters |access-date=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-November, with end-of-year buyer tax credits expiring in a little more than six weeks, Musk announced that the company was aggressively ramping up delivery capabilities with trucking contracts and even outright purchase of some trucking firms to deliver as many cars as possible before the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/15/tesla-acquires-trucking-companies-to-squeeze-in-more-deliveries-before-dec-31/|title=Tesla acquires trucking companies to squeeze in more deliveries before Dec. 31|work=TechCrunch|access-date=November 16, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hacking ===
In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-tesla-hack-20150806-story.html |title=Researchers hack a Tesla Model S, bring car to stop |first=Samantha |last=Masunaga |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 6, 2015 |access-date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mahaffey |first1=Kevin |title=The new assembly line: 3 best practices for building (secure) connected cars |url=https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2015/08/06/tesla-research/ |website=Lookout |date=August 6, 2015 |access-date=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla issued a [[Patch (computing)|security update]] for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/researchers-hacked-model-s-teslas-already/ |title=Tesla patches Model S after researchers hack car's software |first=Fred |last=O'Connor |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=August 7, 2015 |access-date=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, researchers at [[Tencent]]'s Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus ([[CAN bus]]) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://keenlab.tencent.com/en/2016/09/19/Keen-Security-Lab-of-Tencent-Car-Hacking-Research-Remote-Attack-to-Tesla-Cars/ |title=Car Hacking Research: Remote Attack Tesla Motors|access-date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their [[bug bounty program]]&lt;ref name="teslaHack"&gt;{{cite web |title=Product Security {{!}} Tesla |url=https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/about/security?redirect=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190225222341/https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/about/security |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |website=tesla.com |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://electrek.co/2016/09/20/first-tesla-model-s-remotely-controlled-hackers-tesla-pushed-a-fix/ |title=First Tesla Model S remotely controlled by hackers, Tesla already pushed a fix |last=Lambert |first=Fred |date=September 20, 2016 |website=Electrek |access-date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://fortune.com/2017/07/28/tesla-model-x-tencent/ |title=This Tesla Investor's Tech Team Just Hacked the Model X – Again |magazine=Fortune |date=July 28, 2017 |access-date=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an [[Amazon Web Services]] account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for [[cryptocurrency]] mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/20/tesla-hack-amazon-cloud-cryptocurrency-mining/ |title=Tesla Hackers Hijacked Amazon Cloud Account to Mine Cryptocurrency |website=fortune.com |first=Robert |last=Hackett |date=February 20, 2018 |access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://electrek.co/2018/02/20/tesla-cloud-hijacked-hackers-mine-cryptocurrencies/ |title=Tesla's cloud was 'hijacked' by hackers to mine cryptocurrencies |website=electrek.co |first=Fred |last=Lambert |date=February 20, 2018 |access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to [[White hat (computer security)|ethical hackers]] during a [[Pwn2Own]] Model 3 Hacking Event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Villaruel |first1=John Carlo A. |title=Hackers Who Cracked Tesla Model 3 Security In Competition Win Electric Car And $375K |url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/240177/20190324/hackers-who-cracked-tesla-model-3-security-in-competition-win-electric-car-and-375k.htm |website=Tech Times |language=en |date=March 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of [[car carrier]]s and registration.

===Dealership disputes in the United States===
{{Main|Tesla US dealership disputes}}
[[File:Tesla store, Austin, Texas 01.jpg|thumb|Tesla gallery in [[Austin, Texas]] ]]

Tesla operates stores and galleries—usually located in shopping malls—in many U.S. states. However, customers buy vehicles only from the Tesla website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/11/20/tesla-battles-auto-dealers-direct-sales-consumers/3f1xBFN21xH8QqQc3jijTP/story.html |title=Tesla battles auto dealers on direct sales to consumers |newspaper=Boston Globe |first=Callum |last=Borchers |date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stores serve as showrooms that allow people to learn about the company and its vehicles. Some galleries are located in states with restrictive dealer protection laws that prohibit discussing prices or financing, or providing test drives, as well as other restrictions. Forty-eight states have laws that limit or ban manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-20/news/ct-oped-0620-chapman-20130620_1_tesla-motors-car-dealers-car-costs |work=Chicago Tribune |first=Steve |last=Chapman |title=Car buyers get hijacked |date=June 20, 2013 |access-date=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although Tesla has no independent dealerships, dealership associations in multiple states have filed lawsuits over Tesla's sales practices.

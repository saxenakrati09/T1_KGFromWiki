=== Early history ===
In the [[Pre-Columbian era|precolonial era]], the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] Native Americans, including the [[Lenape]]. Their homeland, known as [[Lenapehoking]], included Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of [[Long Island]] (including the areas that would later become the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens), and the [[Lower Hudson Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Evan T.

The first documented visit into [[New York Harbor]] by a European was in 1524 by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer in the service of the [[Kingdom of France|French crown]].&lt;ref name="Debo2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angie Debo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLjYpwiuN_wC&amp;pg=PT28|title=A History of the Indians of the United States|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8061-8965-9|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the area for France and named it ''Nouvelle Angoulême'' ([[New Angoulême]]).&lt;ref name="rodgers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rankin|first1=Rebecca B.|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.226262|title=New York: The World's Capital City, Its Development and Contributions to Progress|last2=Rodgers|first2=Cleveland|publisher=Harper|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] expedition, led by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] captain [[Estêvão Gomes]] sailing for [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], arrived in [[New York Harbor]] in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named ''Río de San Antonio'' (Saint Anthony's River). The [[Padrón Real]] of 1527, the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously, was informed by Gomes' expedition and labeled the [[northeastern United States]] as ''Tierra de Esteban Gómez'' in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;WPA Writer's Project: ''A Maritime History of New York'', p. 246; Going Coastal Productions (2004) {{ISBN|0-9729803-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1614, the area between [[Cape Cod]] and [[Delaware Bay]] was claimed by the [[Netherlands]] and called ''Nieuw-Nederland'' ([[New Netherland]]).

The first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was [[Juan (Jan) Rodriguez|Juan Rodriguez]] ([[Transliteration|transliterated]] to Dutch as ''Jan Rodrigues''), a merchant from [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]]. Born in [[Santo Domingo]] of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch.

Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a [[monopoly]] in New Netherland, on authority granted by the [[States General of the Netherlands|Dutch States General]]. In 1639–1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the [[Netherlands Antilles|Dutch West Indies]]).&lt;ref name="npsnetherland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nahcnetherland"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of New Amsterdam|url=http://www.newamsterdamhistorycenter.org/bios/origins.html|access-date=July 10, 2016|publisher=New Amsterdam History Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City is situated in the [[northeastern United States]], in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Boston]]. The location at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]], which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of [[Long Island]], Manhattan, and Staten Island.

The [[Hudson River]] flows through the [[Hudson Valley]] into [[New York Bay]]. Between New York City and [[Troy, New York]], the river is an [[estuary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information About the Hudson River Estuary|url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/marinebio/fc.1.estuaries.html|access-date=August 20, 2011|publisher=Life.bio.sunysb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of [[New Jersey]]. The [[East River]]—a [[tidal strait]]—flows from [[Long Island Sound]] and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island.

There are [[:Category:Neighborhoods in New York City|hundreds of distinct neighborhoods]] throughout the boroughs, many with a definable history and character. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States (Staten Island would be ranked 37th as of 2020); these same boroughs are coterminous with the four most densely populated counties in the United States: New York (Manhattan), Kings (Brooklyn), Bronx, and Queens.

Most of the borough is situated on [[Manhattan Island]], at the mouth of the Hudson River. Several small islands also compose part of the borough of Manhattan, including [[Randall's Island]], [[Wards Island]], and [[Roosevelt Island]] in the East River, and [[Governors Island]] and [[Liberty Island]] to the south in [[New York Harbor]]. Manhattan Island is loosely divided into the [[Lower Manhattan|Lower]], [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], and [[Upper Manhattan|Uptown]] regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the [[Upper East Side]] and the [[Upper West Side]], and above the park is [[Harlem]]. Harlem was predominantly occupied by Jewish and Italian Americans in the 19th century until the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. It was the center of the [[Harlem Renaissance]].

The borough of Manhattan also includes a small neighborhood on the mainland, called [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]], which is contiguous with the Bronx. New York City's remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the ''Outer Boroughs''.{{Wide image|10 mile panorama of NYC, Feb., 2018.jpg|1400px|Ten mile (16km) [[Manhattan]] [[skyline]] panorama from [[120th Street (Manhattan)|120th Street]] to [[The Battery (Manhattan)|the Battery]], taken in February 2018 from across the [[Hudson River]] in [[Weehawken, New Jersey]].

[[Downtown Brooklyn]] is the largest central core neighborhood in the Outer Boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including [[Coney Island]], established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Immerso|first=Michael|title=Coney Island: The People's Playground|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8135-3138-0|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marine Park (Brooklyn park)|Marine Park]] and [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] are the two largest parks in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=C.J.|date=August 21, 2016|title=Marine Park, Brooklyn: Block Parties, Bocce and Salt Air|website=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/realestate/marine-park-brooklyn-block-parties-bocce-and-salt-air.html|access-date=October 29, 2017|quote=The neighborhood of Marine Park, a compact enclave in southeast Brooklyn, has a major claim to fame.

[[Downtown Flushing]] has become one of the busiest central core neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. Queens is the site of [[Citi Field]], the [[baseball stadium]] of the [[New York Mets]], and hosts the annual [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open tennis tournament]] at [[Flushing Meadows-Corona Park]]. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] and [[LaGuardia Airport]], are located in Queens. The third is [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], New Jersey.

==== The Bronx ====
[[The Bronx]] (Bronx County) is New York City's northernmost borough and the only New York City borough that lies mainly on the mainland United States. It is the location of [[Yankee Stadium]], the baseball park of the [[New York Yankees]], and home to the largest [[Housing cooperative|cooperatively owned housing]] complex in the United States, [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frazier|first=Ian|date=June 26, 2006|title=Utopia, the Bronx|work=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/26/060626fa_fact_frazier|access-date=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also home to the [[Bronx Zoo]], the world's largest metropolitan zoo,&lt;ref name="BronxZoo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bronx Zoo Animals &amp; Exhibits|url=http://www.bronxzoo.com/animals-and-exhibits.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114073313/http://bronxzoo.com/animals-and-exhibits.aspx|archive-date=January 14, 2015|access-date=March 20, 2016|publisher=Wildlife Conservation Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; which spans {{convert|265|acre|km2}} and houses more than 6,000 animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Candace|title=New York City Museum Guide|publisher=Dover Publications|year=2000|isbn=978-0-486-41000-5|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronx is also the birthplace of [[Hip hop music|hip hop music]] and [[hip hop culture|culture]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Toop|first=David|title=Rap Attack 2: African Rap to Global Hip Hop|publisher=Serpents Tail|year=1992|isbn=978-1-85242-243-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pelham Bay Park]] is the largest park in New York City, at {{convert|2772|acre|ha}}.&lt;ref name="nyt20130601"&gt;{{cite news|author=Foderaro, Lisa W.|date=May 31, 2013|title=How Big Is That Park?

==== Staten Island ====
[[Staten Island]] (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]], and to Manhattan by way of the free [[Staten Island Ferry]], a daily [[commuter]] ferry which provides unobstructed views of the [[Statue of Liberty]], [[Ellis Island]], and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the [[Staten Island Greenbelt]] spans approximately {{convert|2500|acres|km2|abbr=on}}, including {{convert|28|mi|km}} of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staten Island Greenbelt &amp;#124; New York-New Jersey Trail Conference|url=http://www.nynjtc.org/park/staten-island-greenbelt|access-date=October 28, 2010|publisher=Nynjtc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.&lt;gallery class="center" widths="330" heights="200"&gt;

According to the [[United States Geological Survey]], an updated analysis of [[seismic hazard]] in July 2014 revealed a "slightly lower hazard for tall buildings" in New York City than previously assessed.

The City of New York has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the [[National Park Service]], the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]], and the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]. In its 2018 ParkScore ranking, [[The Trust for Public Land]] reported that the park system in New York City was the ninth-best park system among the fifty most populous U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ParkScore 2018: City Rankings|url=https://parkscore.tpl.org/rankings.php|access-date=November 8, 2018|website=[[The Trust for Public Land]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ParkScore ranks urban park systems by a formula that analyzes median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of city residents within a half-mile of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents.

[[File:FDNY_Tower_Ladder_1_(897367891).jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[New York City Fire Department|Fire Department of New York]] (FDNY) is the largest municipal fire department in the United States.]]
The [[New York City Fire Department|Fire Department of New York]] (FDNY), provides [[fire protection]], technical rescue, primary response to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards, and [[emergency medical services]] for the five boroughs of New York City. The FDNY is the largest municipal [[fire department]] in the United States and the second largest in the world after the [[Tokyo Fire Department]]. The FDNY employs approximately 11,080 uniformed [[firefighter]]s and more than 3,300 uniformed [[Emergency medical technician|EMTs]] and [[paramedic]]s. The FDNY's motto is ''New York's Bravest''.

The fire department faces multifaceted firefighting challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to [[List of building types|building types]] that range from wood-frame single family homes to [[High-rise|high-rise structures]], the FDNY also responds to fires that occur in the [[New York City Subway]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=730260&lt;/ref&gt; Secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires, also present challenges.

The FDNY headquarters is located at [[9 MetroTech Center]] in [[Downtown Brooklyn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9 Metrotech Center—FDNY Headquarters|url=http://www.fmmcorp.com/p_gov5.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118054305/http://www.fmmcorp.com/p_gov5.html|archive-date=January 18, 2012|access-date=November 5, 2009|publisher=Fresh Meadow Mechanical Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the FDNY Fire Academy is located on [[Randalls and Wards Islands|Randalls Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDNY Fire Academy|url=http://nyc.gov/html/fdny/html/units/fire_academy/fa_index.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014104143/http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/html/units/fire_academy/fa_index.shtml|archive-date=October 14, 2014|access-date=October 8, 2014|publisher=The City of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three Bureau of Fire Communications alarm offices which receive and dispatch alarms to appropriate units.

New York City is well known for its street [[parade]]s, which celebrate a broad array of themes, including holidays, nationalities, human rights, and major league sports team championship victories.

=== Accent and dialect ===
{{Main|New York City English|New York accent}}
The New York area is home to a distinctive regional speech pattern called the [[New York City English|New York dialect]], alternatively known as ''Brooklynese'' or ''New Yorkese''. It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within [[American English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Michael|title=American Voices|publisher=Blackwell|year=2005|isbn=978-1-4051-2109-5|editor1-last=Wolfram|editor1-first=Walt|pages=82–87|chapter=New York Talk|editor2-last=Ward|editor2-first=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional New York area accent is characterized as [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], so that the sound {{IPA|[ɹ]}} does not appear at the end of a [[syllable]] or immediately before a [[consonant]]; therefore the pronunciation of the city name as "New Yawk."&lt;ref name="NYT19930214"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sontag|first=Deborah|date=February 14, 1993|title=Oy Gevalt! New Yawkese An Endangered Dialect?|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0D61438F937A25751C0A965958260|access-date=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no {{IPA|[ɹ]}} in words like ''park'' {{IPA|[pɑək]}} or {{IPA|[pɒək]}} (with vowel backed and [[Vowel breaking|diphthongized]] due to the low-back chain shift), ''butter'' {{IPA|[bʌɾə]}}, or ''here'' {{IPA|[hiə]}}. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the {{IPA|[ɔ]}} vowel sound of words like ''talk'', ''law'', ''cross'', ''chocolate'', and ''coffee'' and the often [[homophonous]] {{IPA|[ɔr]}} in ''core'' and ''more'' are tensed and usually raised more than in [[General American]] English. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like "girl" and of words like "oil" became a diphthong {{IPA|[ɜɪ]}}. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced "goil" and ''oil'' is pronounced "erl"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like "Joizey" (Jersey), "Toidy-Toid Street" (33rd St.) and "terlet" (toilet).&lt;ref name="NYT19930214" /&gt; The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the 1970s [[Sitcom|television sitcom]] ''[[All in the Family]]'' was an example of having used this pattern of speech.

The classic version of the New York City dialect is generally centered on [[Middle class|middle]] and working-class New Yorkers. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect,&lt;ref name="NYT19930214" /&gt; and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as it has been in the past.&lt;ref name="NYT19930214" /&gt;

Additionally, there have been 14 World Series in which two New York City teams played each other, known as a [[Subway Series]] and occurring most recently in {{wsy|2000}}.

Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who [[Commuting|commute]] into Manhattan, it is quite common for motorists to be stranded for hours in [[traffic congestion]] that are a daily occurrence, particularly during [[rush hour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://ny.curbed.com/2019/8/15/20807470/nyc-streets-dot-mobility-report-congestion | title=New York City's streets are 'more congested than ever': report | first1=Amy | last1=Plitt | first2=Valeria | last2=Ricciulli | work=[[Curbed]] | date=August 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.crainsnewyork.com/op-ed/solving-citys-traffic-nightmares | title=Solving the city's traffic nightmares | first=Jason M. | last=Barr | work=[[Crain Communications]] | date=September 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Congestion pricing in New York City]] will go into effect in 2022 at the earliest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/2019/04/02/709243878/new-york-is-set-to-be-first-u-s-city-to-impose-congestion-pricing | title=New York Is Set To Be First U.S. City To Impose Congestion Pricing | first=LAUREL | last=WAMSLEY | work=[[NPR]] | date=April 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.archpaper.com/2020/07/federal-government-delays-nyc-congestion-pricing/ | title=Federal government delays NYC congestion pricing by at least a year | first=Jonathan | last=Hilburg | work=[[The Architect's Newspaper]] | date=July 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://gothamist.com/news/congestion-pricings-failure-shining-example-government-dysfunction | title=Congestion Pricing's Failure A "Shining Example" Of Government Dysfunction | first=CHRISTOPHER | last=ROBBINS | work=[[Gothamist]] | date=July 15, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City is also known for its rules regarding turning at red lights. Unlike the rest of the United States, New York State prohibits right or left turns on red in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City, therefore, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chapter 4: Traffic Control |url=https://dmv.ny.gov/about-dmv/chapter-4-traffic-control-2 | publisher=[[New York State Department of Motor Vehicles]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City is located on one of the world's largest natural harbors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://play.history.com/shows/how-the-earth-was-made/videos/new-york-harbor#new-york-harbor | title=New York Harbor Video—How the Earth Was Made | publisher=[[History.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are primarily coterminous with islands of the same names, while Queens and Brooklyn are located at the west end of the larger Long Island, and the Bronx is located on New York State's mainland. This situation of boroughs separated by water led to the development of an extensive infrastructure of bridges and tunnels.

The [[George Washington Bridge]] is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge,&lt;ref name="gwbridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gwbridgepainters" /&gt; connecting Manhattan to [[Bergen County, New Jersey]]. The [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] is the longest [[suspension bridge]] in the Americas and one of the world's longest.&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Longest Suspension Bridges in the World|url=http://www.infoplease.com/toptens/worldsuspbridges.html|access-date=September 7, 2012|publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verrazano-Narrows Bridge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Verrazano-Narrows Bridge|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/verrazano-narrows/|access-date=September 7, 2012|publisher=Eastern Roads}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brooklyn Bridge]] is an icon of the city itself. The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of [[limestone]], [[granite]], and Rosendale cement, and their architectural style is neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge. The [[Queensboro Bridge]] is an important piece of [[Cantilever bridge|cantilever architecture]]. The [[Manhattan Bridge]], opened in 1909, is considered to be the forerunner of modern [[suspension bridge]]s, and its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world; the Manhattan Bridge, [[Throgs Neck Bridge]], [[Triborough Bridge]], and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge are all examples of [[Structural Expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyc-architecture.com/BRI/BRI002-ManhattanBridge.htm New York Architecture Images-Manhattan Bridge].

Manhattan Island is linked to New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey by several tunnels as well. The [[Lincoln Tunnel]], which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Tunnel Historic Overview|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/lincoln/|access-date=August 13, 2014|publisher=Eastern Roads}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and [[cargo ship]]s that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The [[Holland Tunnel]], connecting Lower Manhattan to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], was the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/holland/ Holland Tunnel (I-78)].

=== Cycling network ===
{{Main|Cycling in New York City}}
[[Cycling in New York City]] is associated with mixed cycling conditions that include urban density, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with "stop-and-go" traffic, and many pedestrians. The city's large cycling population includes [[Utility cycling|utility cyclists]], such as delivery and messenger services; [[cycling club]]s for recreational cyclists; and increasingly [[Bicycle commuting|commuters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fried |first=Ben|date=November 9, 2009|title=Count on It: NYC Bike Commuting Climbs 26 Percent| url=http://www.streetsblog.org/2009/11/09/count-on-it-nyc-bike-commuting-climbs-26-percent/ |access-date=February 26, 2010|work=streetsblog.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cycling is increasingly popular in New York City; in 2017 there were approximately 450,000 daily bike trips, compared with 170,000 daily bike trips in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Hu, Winnie.

In 2006, the [[Twin towns and sister cities|Sister City]] Program of the City of New York, Inc. was restructured and renamed ''New York City Global Partners''. Through this program, New York City has expanded its international outreach to a network of cities worldwide, promoting the exchange of ideas and [[innovation]] between their citizenry and policymakers. New York's ''historic sister cities'' are denoted below by the year they joined New York City's partnership network.&lt;ref name="GlobalOutreach"&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC's Partner Cities|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/ia/gp/html/partner/partner.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814165415/http://www.nyc.gov/html/ia/gp/html/partner/partner.shtml|archive-date=August 14, 2013|access-date=March 26, 2015|publisher=The City of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

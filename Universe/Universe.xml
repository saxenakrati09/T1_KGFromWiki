The earliest [[Timeline of cosmological theories|cosmological models]] of the universe were developed by [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] and [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] and were [[geocentric model|geocentric]], placing [[Earth]] at the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From China to Paris: 2000 Years Transmission of Mathematical Ideas |first=Yvonne |last=Dold-Samplonius |date=2002 |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval Science Technology and Medicine: An Encyclopedia |first1=Thomas F. |last1=Glick |first2=Steven |last2=Livesey |first3=Faith |last3=Wallis |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] to develop the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] with the [[Sun]] at the center of the [[Solar System]]. In developing the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], [[Isaac Newton]] built upon Copernicus's work as well as [[Johannes Kepler]]'s [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]] and observations by [[Tycho Brahe]].

Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the [[Milky Way]], which is one of at least two trillion galaxies in the universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy [[exoplanet|have planets]]. [[Observable universe#End of Greatness|At the largest scale]], galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in [[open cluster|clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s which form immense [[galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[void (astronomy)|voids]] in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics |last1=Carroll|first1=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=July 23, 2013|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-1-292-02293-2|edition=International|pages=1173–74|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and that [[Expansion of the universe|space has been expanding]], since then,&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hawking, Stephen|url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofti00step_1|title=A Brief History of Time|date=1988|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=978-0-553-05340-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofti00step_1/page/43 43]|author-link=Stephen Hawking|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.&lt;ref name="nobel_2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 |access-date=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[cosmological]] description of the development of the universe. According to estimation of this theory, space and time emerged together {{val|13.799|0.021|u=billion years}} ago&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Planck Collaboration|year=2016|title=Planck 2015 results.

After an initial accelerated expansion called the [[inflationary epoch]] at around 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, and the separation of the four known [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]], the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first [[subatomic particle]]s and simple [[atom]]s to form. [[Dark matter]] gradually gathered, forming a [[foam]]-like structure of [[galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[void (astronomy)|voids]] under the influence of [[gravity]]. Giant clouds of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most [[density|dense]], forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today. It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion [[light-year]]s because [[expansion of the universe|space itself has expanded]], and it is still expanding today. This means that objects which are now up to 46.5 billion light-years away can [[observable universe|still be seen]] in their distant past, because in the past, when their light was emitted, they were much closer to Earth.

From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more [[matter]] than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as dark matter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Redd|first1=Nola|title=What is Dark Matter?|url=https://www.space.com/20930-dark-matter.html|website=Space.com|access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''dark'' means that there is a wide range of strong [[circumstantial evidence|indirect evidence]] that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). The [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM]] model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about {{val|69.2|1.2|u=%}} [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a [[cosmological constant]] (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other forms of [[dark energy]], such as a [[scalar field]]) which is responsible for the current [[expansion of the universe|expansion of space]], and about {{val|25.8|1.1|u=%}} [2015] is dark matter.&lt;ref name="planck_2015"&gt;[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/10/aa27101-15/T9.html Planck 2015 results, table 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary ('[[Baryon#Baryonic matter|baryonic]]') matter is therefore only {{val|4.84|0.1|u=%}} [2015] of the physical universe.&lt;ref name="planck_2015" /&gt; Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of ordinary matter, or about 0.29% of the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Persic| first1 = Massimo| last2 = Salucci| first2 = Paolo| date = September 1, 1992| title = The baryon content of the Universe| url = http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/258/1/14P| journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| volume = 258| issue = 1| pages = 14P–18P| doi = 10.1093/mnras/258.1.14P| issn = 0035-8711| arxiv = astro-ph/0502178 |bibcode = 1992MNRAS.258P..14P | s2cid = 17945298}}: states "less than 10%" but also provides a more exact value of 0.3% of the universe, which is about 6% of baryonic matter [4.9% according to Planck 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many competing hypotheses about the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various [[multiverse]] hypotheses, in which our universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.&lt;ref name="Brian Greene 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EllisKS032" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Jason.

== Etymology ==
The word ''universe'' derives from the [[Old French]] word ''univers'', which in turn derives from the [[Latin]] word ''universum''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', volume II, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 3518.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word was used by [[Cicero]] and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern [[English language|English]] word is used.&lt;ref name="lewis_short"&gt;Lewis, C.T. and Short, S (1879) ''A Latin Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-864201-6}}, pp. 1933, 1977–1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synonyms ===
A term for "universe" among the ancient Greek philosophers from [[Pythagoras]] onwards was {{lang|grc|τὸ πᾶν}}, ''tò pân'' ("the all"), defined as all matter and all space, and {{lang|grc|τὸ ὅλον}}, ''tò hólon'' ("all things"), which did not necessarily include the void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott | title=A Greek-English Lexicon | quote=πᾶς | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/πᾶς}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott | title=A Greek-English Lexicon | quote=ὅλος | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/ὅλος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another synonym was {{lang|grc|ὁ κόσμος}}, ''ho kósmos'' (meaning the [[world (philosophy)|world]], the [[cosmos]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott |title = A Greek–English Lexicon | quote = κόσμος | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/κόσμος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms are also found in Latin authors (''totum'', ''mundus'', ''natura'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lewis, C.T. | author2=Short, S | date=1879 | title=A Latin Dictionary | url=https://archive.org/details/latindictionaryf00lewi | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-864201-5 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/latindictionaryf00lewi/page/n1188 1175], 1189–90, 1881–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; and survive in modern languages, e.g., the German words ''Das All'', ''Weltall'', and ''Natur'' for ''universe''.

== Chronology and the Big Bang ==
{{Main|Big Bang|Chronology of the universe}}
{{Nature timeline}}

The prevailing model for the evolution of the universe is the Big Bang theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Silk|title=Horizons of Cosmology|publisher=Templeton Pressr|date=2009|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Singh|title=Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe|publisher=Harper Perennial|date=2005|page=560|bibcode=2004biba.book.....S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that the universe subsequently expanded and cooled. The model is based on [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. A version of the model with a [[cosmological constant]] (Lambda) and [[cold dark matter]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]], is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and [[redshift]] of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.

The initial hot, dense state is called the [[Planck epoch]], a brief period extending from time zero to one [[Planck time]] unit of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, and [[gravity]]—currently the weakest by far of the [[fundamental interactions|four known forces]]—is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been [[grand unification|unified]]. Since the Planck epoch, space has been [[metric expansion of space|expanding]] to its present scale, with a very short but intense period of [[cosmic inflation]] believed to have occurred within the first [[Scientific Notation|10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt;]] seconds.&lt;ref name=Sivaram&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. Sivaram | journal=Astrophysics and Space Science | date=1986 | volume=125 | issue=1 | pages=189–99 | doi=10.1007/BF00643984 | bibcode=1986Ap&amp;SS.125..189S | title= Evolution of the Universe through the Planck epoch| s2cid=123344693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a kind of expansion different from those we can see around us today. Objects in space did not physically move; instead the [[metric expansion of space|metric]] that defines space itself changed. Although objects in [[spacetime]] cannot move faster than the [[speed of light]], this limitation does not apply to the metric governing spacetime itself. This initial period of inflation is believed to explain why space appears to be very flat, and much larger than light could travel since the start of the universe.{{Clarify|date=May 2020}}

Within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence, the four fundamental forces had separated. As the universe continued to cool down from its inconceivably hot state, various types of [[subatomic particles]] were able to form in short periods of time known as the [[quark epoch]], the [[hadron epoch]], and the [[lepton epoch]]. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. These [[elementary particle]]s associated stably into ever larger combinations, including stable [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, which then formed more complex [[atomic nuclei]] through [[nuclear fusion]]. This process, known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], only lasted for about 17 minutes and ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred. About 25% of the [[proton]]s and all the [[neutron]]s in the universe, by mass, were converted to [[helium]], with small amounts of [[deuterium]] (a [[isotope|form]] of [[hydrogen]]) and traces of [[lithium]]. Any other [[chemical element|element]] was only formed in very tiny quantities. The other 75% of the protons remained unaffected, as [[hydrogen]] nuclei.

After nucleosynthesis ended, the universe entered a period known as the [[photon epoch]]. During this period, the universe was still far too hot for matter to form neutral [[atom]]s, so it contained a hot, dense, foggy [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of negatively charged [[electron]]s, neutral [[neutrino]]s and positive nuclei. After about 377,000 years, the universe had cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could form the first stable [[atom]]s. This is known as [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] for historical reasons; in fact electrons and nuclei were combining for the first time. Unlike plasma, neutral atoms are [[Opacity (optics)|transparent]] to many [[wavelength]]s of light, so for the first time the universe also became transparent. The photons released ("[[photon decoupling|decoupled]]") when these atoms formed can still be seen today; they form the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB).

As the universe expands, the [[energy density]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] decreases more quickly than does that of [[matter]] because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. At around 47,000 years, the [[energy density]] of matter became larger than that of photons and [[neutrino]]s, and began to dominate the large scale behavior of the universe. This marked the end of the [[radiation-dominated era]] and the start of the [[matter-dominated era]].

In the earliest stages of the universe, tiny fluctuations within the universe's density led to [[filament (cosmology)|concentrations]] of [[dark matter]] gradually forming. Ordinary matter, attracted to these by [[gravity]], formed large gas clouds and eventually, stars and galaxies, where the dark matter was most dense, and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] where it was least dense. After around 100 - 300 million years,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} the first [[star]]s formed, known as [[Population III]] stars. These were probably very massive, luminous, [[metallicity|non metallic]] and short-lived. They were responsible for the gradual [[reionization]] of the universe between about 200-500 million years and 1 billion years, and also for seeding the universe with elements heavier than helium, through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Scientific American | title= The First Stars in the Universe |first1=Richard B. |last1=Larson |first2=Volker |last2=Bromm |name-list-style=amp | date=March 2002 | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-first-stars-in-the-un/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The universe also contains a mysterious energy—possibly a [[scalar field]]—called [[dark energy]], the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present [[dark-energy-dominated era]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33&lt;/ref&gt; In this era, the expansion of the universe is [[accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating]] due to dark energy.

Of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s, [[gravitation]] is the dominant at astronomical length scales. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales. The remaining two interactions, the [[weak nuclear force|weak]] and [[strong nuclear force]]s, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.

The universe appears to have much more [[matter]] than [[antimatter]], an asymmetry possibly related to the [[CP violation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=October 28, 2003 |url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp |title=Antimatter |publisher=Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council |access-date=August 10, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307075727/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp |archive-date=March 7, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today, since matter and antimatter, if equally produced at the [[Big Bang]], would have completely annihilated each other and left only [[photon]]s as a result of their interaction.&lt;ref name="TT-20171025"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adamson |first=Allan |title=Universe Should Not Actually Exist: Big Bang Produced Equal Amounts Of Matter And Antimatter |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/214821/20171025/universe-should-not-actually-exist-big-bang-produced-equal-amounts-of-matter-and-antimatter.htm |date=October 19, 2017 |work=TechTimes.com |access-date=October 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20171020"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smorra C. |display-authors=et al |title=A parts-per-billion measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment |date=October 20, 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=550 |issue=7676 |pages=371–74 |doi=10.1038/nature24048 |pmid=29052625 |bibcode=2017Natur.550..371S |s2cid=205260736 |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/2291601/files/nature24048.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The universe also appears to have neither net [[momentum]] nor [[angular momentum]], which follows accepted physical laws if the universe is finite.

Consequently, the sum of the charges on the two sides of the surface is zero."&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the universe is somewhat difficult to define. According to the general theory of relativity, far regions of [[space]] may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the universe due to the finite [[speed of light]] and the ongoing [[expansion of space]]. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.&lt;ref name="Kaku2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michio|last=Kaku|title=Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel|url=https://archive.org/details/physicsofimpossi00kaku|url-access=registration|date=March 11, 2008|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-385-52544-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/physicsofimpossi00kaku/page/202 202]–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and to be part of reality as much as we are, even though we can never interact with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the [[observable universe]]. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler will not be able to interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.&lt;!-- [[Hubble's law]] links to this section --&gt;

=== Age and expansion ===
{{Main|Age of the universe|Metric expansion of space}}
Astronomers calculate the [[age of the universe]] by assuming that the [[Lambda-CDM model]] accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[WMAP]] and [[Planck (satellite)|Planck]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for [[Type Ia supernovae]], and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Assuming that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of the age of the universe as of 2015 of 13.799 [[Measurement uncertainty|±]] 0.021 billion years.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;

Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light-years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been [[redshift]]ed; the [[photon]]s emitted have been stretched to longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency]] during their journey.

The more matter there is in the universe, the stronger the mutual [[gravitational]] pull of the matter. If the universe were ''too'' dense then it would re-collapse into a [[gravitational singularity]]. However, if the universe contained too ''little'' matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures, like galaxies or planets, to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded [[monotonic]]ally. [[Anthropic principle#Anthropic coincidences|Perhaps unsurprisingly]], our universe has [[Critical Mass Density of the Universe|just the right mass-energy density]], equivalent to about 5 protons per cubic metre, which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | first1=Sean | last1=Carroll | author1-link=Sean Carroll (physicist) |first2=Michio|last2=Kaku|author2-link=Michio Kaku | series=How the Universe Works | title=End of the Universe | date=2014 | network=Discovery Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the universe; and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the universe called the [[deceleration parameter]], which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative, approximately -0.55, which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic [[scale factor cosmology|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a}&lt;/math&gt; has been positive in the last 5-6 billion years.&lt;ref name="nobel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=A 'Cosmic Jerk' That Reversed the Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/11/us/a-cosmic-jerk-that-reversed-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceleration does not, however, imply that the Hubble parameter is currently increasing; see [[deceleration parameter]] for details.

=== Spacetime ===

Spacetimes are the arenas in which all physical events take place. The basic elements of spacetimes are [[event (relativity)|events]]. In any given spacetime, an event is defined as a unique position at a unique time. A spacetime is the union of all events (in the same way that a line is the union of all of its points), formally organized into a [[manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Spacetime [[event (relativity)|events]] are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally but rather are known to be relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]].

=== Shape ===
{{Main|Shape of the universe}}
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|The three possible options for the shape of the universe]]

General relativity describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy (gravity). The [[topology]] or [[geometry]] of the universe includes both [[Shape of the universe#Local geometry (spatial curvature)|local geometry]] in the [[observable universe]] and [[Shape of the universe#Global geometry|global geometry]]. Cosmologists often work with a given [[space-like]] slice of spacetime called the [[Comoving distance|comoving coordinates]]. The section of spacetime which can be observed is the backward [[light cone]], which delimits the [[cosmological horizon]]. The cosmological horizon (also called the particle horizon or the light horizon) is the maximum distance from which [[Elementary particle|particles]] can have traveled to the [[observation|observer]] in the [[age of the universe]]. This horizon represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robert Harrison|title=Cosmology: the science of the universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&amp;pg=PA447|access-date=May 1, 2011|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66148-5|pages=447–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Andrew R.|last1=Liddle|author2=David Hilary Lyth|title=Cosmological inflation and large-scale structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmWauPZSovMC&amp;pg=PA24|access-date=May 1, 2011|date=April 13, 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57598-0|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular [[cosmological model]].

An important parameter determining the future evolution of the universe theory is the [[density parameter]], Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density.

The universe may be ''fine-tuned''; the Fine-tuned universe hypothesis is the proposition that the conditions that allow the existence of observable [[life]] in the universe can only occur when certain universal [[physical constant|fundamental physical constants]] lie within a very narrow range of values, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the universe would have been unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of [[matter]], astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood.&lt;ref name=toa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI301.html |title=CI301: The Anthropic Principle |access-date=October 31, 2007 |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Isaak |date=2005 |work=Index to Creationist Claims |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposition is discussed among [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[science|scientists]], [[theology|theologians]], and proponents of [[creationism]].

Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to [[vacuum energy]]. Scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant.

=== Dark matter ===
{{main|Dark matter}}
Dark matter is a hypothetical kind of [[matter]] that is invisible to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]], but which accounts for most of the matter in the universe. The existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] of the universe. Other than [[neutrinos]], a form of [[hot dark matter]], dark matter has not been detected directly, making it one of the greatest mysteries in modern [[astrophysics]]. Dark matter neither [[blackbody spectrum|emits]] nor absorbs light or any other [[electromagnetic radiation]] at any significant level. Dark matter is estimated to constitute 26.8% of the total mass–energy and 84.5% &lt;!--26.8/(4.9 + 26.8)--&gt; of the total matter in the universe.&lt;ref name = DarkMatter&gt;Sean Carroll, Ph.D., Caltech, 2007, The Teaching Company, ''Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe'', Guidebook Part 2 p. 46, Accessed October 7, 2013, "...dark matter: An invisible, essentially collisionless component of matter that makes up about 25 percent of the energy density of the universe... it's a different kind of particle... something not yet observed in the laboratory..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=planckcam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/planck-captures-portrait-of-the-young-universe-revealing-earliest-light |title=Planck captures portrait of the young universe, revealing earliest light |date=March 21, 2013 |publisher=University of Cambridge |access-date=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ordinary matter ===
{{main|Matter}}
The remaining 4.9% of the mass–energy of the universe is ordinary matter, that is, [[atom]]s, [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s and the objects they form. This matter includes [[star]]s, which produce nearly all of the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] and [[intergalactic medium|intergalactic]] media, [[planet]]s, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze.&lt;ref name=Davies2&gt;

Ordinary matter commonly exists in four [[state of matter|states]] (or [[phase (matter)|phases]]): [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. However, advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases, such as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s and [[fermionic condensate]]s.

Ordinary matter is composed of two types of [[elementary particle]]s: [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s.&lt;ref name=Hooft&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the proton is formed of two [[up quarks]] and one [[down quark]]; the neutron is formed of two down quarks and one up quark; and the electron is a kind of lepton. An atom consists of an [[atomic nucleus]], made up of protons and neutrons, and electrons that orbit the nucleus. Because most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which is made up of [[baryons]], astronomers often use the term ''baryonic matter'' to describe ordinary matter, although a small fraction of this "baryonic matter" is electrons.

Soon after the [[Big Bang]], primordial protons and neutrons formed from the [[quark–gluon plasma]] of the early universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in a process known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]], but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some [[boron]] may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, [[carbon]], was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding universe. Subsequent formation of [[metallicity|heavier elements]] resulted from [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Clayton1983&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Donald D.|title=Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofstel0000clay|url-access=registration|date=1983|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10953-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/principlesofstel0000clay/page/362 362–435]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hadrons ====
{{Main|Hadron}}
A hadron is a [[composite particle]] made of [[quark]]s [[bound state|held together]] by the [[strong force]]. Hadrons are categorized into two families: [[baryon]]s (such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) made of three quarks, and [[meson]]s (such as [[pion]]s) made of one quark and one [[antiparticle|antiquark]]. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern universe. From approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]], during a period is known as the [[hadron epoch]], the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the universe was dominated by [[hadron]]s. Initially, the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the universe was about one second old.&lt;ref name=Allday2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allday|first1=Jonathan|title=Quarks, Leptons and the Big Bang|date=2002|publisher=IOP Publishing|isbn=978-0-7503-0806-9|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|244–66}}

==== Leptons ====
{{main|Lepton}}
A lepton is an [[elementary particle|elementary]], [[half-integer spin]] particle that does not undergo strong interactions but is subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; no two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main classes of leptons exist: [[electric charge|charged]] leptons (also known as the ''electron-like'' leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as [[neutrino]]s). Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe, whereas [[muon]]s and [[tau (particle)|taus]] are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in [[high energy physics|high energy]] collisions, such as those involving [[cosmic ray]]s or carried out in [[particle accelerator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[lepton epoch]] was the period in the evolution of the early universe in which the [[lepton]]s dominated the mass of the universe. It started roughly 1 second after the [[Big Bang]], after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the [[hadron epoch]]. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermal history of the universe and early growth of density fluctuations|url=http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~gamk/TUM_Lectures/Lecture4.pdf|work=Guinevere Kauffmann|publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]|access-date=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons.

==== Photons ====
{{Main|Photon epoch}}
{{See also|Photino}}
A photon is the [[quantum]] of [[light]] and all other forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is the [[force carrier]] for the [[electromagnetic force]], even when [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|static]] via [[virtual photons]]. The effects of this [[force]] are easily observable at the [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] and at the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] level because the photon has zero [[rest mass]]; this allows long distance [[fundamental interaction|interactions]]. Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by [[quantum mechanics]] and exhibit [[wave–particle duality]], exhibiting properties of [[wave]]s and of [[wikt:particle|particles]].

The photon epoch started after most leptons and anti-leptons were [[annihilation|annihilated]] at the end of the lepton epoch, about 10 seconds after the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch. For the remainder of the photon epoch the universe contained a hot dense [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of nuclei, electrons and photons. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms. As a result, photons no longer interacted frequently with matter and the universe became transparent. The highly redshifted photons from this period form the cosmic microwave background. Tiny variations in temperature and density detectable in the CMB were the early "seeds" from which all subsequent [[structure formation]] took place.&lt;ref name=Allday2002/&gt;{{rp|244–66}}

== Cosmological models ==
=== Model of the universe based on general relativity ===
{{main|Solutions of the Einstein field equations}}
{{See also|Big Bang|Ultimate fate of the universe}}
[[General relativity]] is the [[Differential geometry|geometric]] [[Theoretical physics|theory]] of [[gravitation]] published by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in [[modern physics]]. It is the basis of current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of the universe. General relativity generalizes [[special relativity]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[Time in physics|time]], or spacetime. In particular, the [[curvature]] of spacetime is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the [[acceleration]] of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the universe over time.&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt;

With the assumption of the [[cosmological principle]] that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, a specific solution of the field equations that describes the universe is the [[metric tensor]] called the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]],
:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = -c^{2} dt^2 +
R(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where (''r'', θ, φ) correspond to a [[spherical coordinate system]]. This [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] has only two undetermined parameters. An overall [[dimensionless]] length [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''R'' describes the size scale of the universe as a function of time; an increase in ''R'' is the [[expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A curvature index ''k'' describes the geometry. The index ''k'' is defined so that it can take only one of three values: 0, corresponding to flat [[Euclidean geometry]]; 1, corresponding to a space of positive [[curvature]]; or −1, corresponding to a space of positive or negative curvature.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas66" /&gt; The value of ''R'' as a function of time ''t'' depends upon ''k'' and the [[cosmological constant]] ''Λ''.&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |last1=Zeilik |first1=Michael |last2=Gregory |first2=Stephen A. |date=1998 |edition=4th |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-006228-5 | section=25-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; The equation describing how ''R'' varies with time is known as the [[Friedmann equation]] after its inventor, [[Alexander Friedmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Friedmann A.|date = 1922|title = Über die Krümmung des Raumes|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 377–86|doi = 10.1007/BF01332580|bibcode = 1922ZPhy...10..377F|s2cid = 125190902|author-link = Alexander Friedmann|url=http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/16735/E001554876.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solutions for ''R(t)'' depend on ''k'' and ''Λ'', but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale ''R'' of the universe can remain constant ''only'' if the universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (''k''=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt; However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the universe is known to be inhomogeneous on smaller scales, ''R'' must change over time. When ''R'' changes, all the spatial distances in the universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light-years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and never moved faster than the [[speed of light]].

Second, all solutions suggest that there was a [[gravitational singularity]] in the past, when ''R'' went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because it is based on the questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]] show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, ''R'' grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when ''R'' had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the [[Big Bang]] model of the universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a [[quantum theory of gravity]], which has not yet been formulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=122–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, the curvature index ''k'' determines the sign of the mean spatial curvature of spacetime&lt;ref name="RaineThomas66"&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion [[light-year]]s). If ''k''=1, the curvature is positive and the universe has a finite volume.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas70" /&gt; A universe with positive curvature is often visualized as a [[3-sphere|three-dimensional sphere]] embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if ''k'' is zero or negative, the universe has an infinite volume.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas70"&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when ''R''=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when ''k'' does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a [[torus]] is finite in both. A toroidal universe could behave like a normal universe with [[periodic boundary conditions]].

The [[ultimate fate of the universe]] is still unknown because it depends critically on the curvature index ''k'' and the cosmological constant ''Λ''. If the universe were sufficiently dense, ''k'' would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the universe will eventually recollapse in a [[Big Crunch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly starting a new universe in a [[Big Bounce]]. Conversely, if the universe were insufficiently dense, ''k'' would equal 0 or −1 and the universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the [[Future of an expanding universe|Big Freeze]] and the [[heat death of the universe]].&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt; Modern data suggests that the rate of expansion of the universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the universe may eventually reach a [[Big Rip]]. Observationally, the universe appears to be flat (''k'' = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=88, 110–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiverse hypothesis ===
{{Main|Multiverse|Many-worlds interpretation|Bubble universe theory|Parallel universe (fiction)}}
{{See also|Eternal inflation}}
Some speculative theories have proposed that our universe is but one of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the [[multiverse]], challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the universe.&lt;ref name="EllisKS032"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Munitz MK|date = 1959|title = One Universe or Many?|journal = Journal of the History of Ideas|volume = 12|pages = 231–55|doi = 10.2307/2707516|issue = 2|jstor = 2707516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific multiverse models are distinct from concepts such as [[plane (esotericism)|alternate planes of consciousness]] and [[simulated reality]].

[[Max Tegmark]] developed a four-part [[Multiverse#Max Tegmark's four levels|classification scheme]] for the different types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in response to various [[Physics]] problems. An example of such multiverses is the one resulting from the [[bubble universe theory|chaotic inflation]] model of the early universe.&lt;ref name="chaotic_inflation"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Linde A.|date = 1986|title = Eternal chaotic inflation|journal = Mod.

In this interpretation, parallel worlds are generated in a manner similar to [[quantum superposition]] and [[decoherence]], with all states of the [[wave function]]s being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, in the many-worlds interpretation the multiverse evolves as a [[universal wavefunction]]. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.&lt;ref name=everett1957&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Everett | first1 = Hugh | author-link = Hugh Everett | year = 1957 | title = Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 454–62 |bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..454E |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.29.454 | s2cid = 17178479 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/066c796be96aaec3ed3e77b99f5589f8847bf34f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, there have been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal universe governed by physical laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt; Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the universe including both all of space and all of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gernet|first = J.|date = 1993–1994|title=Space and time: Science and religion in the encounter between China and Europe|journal=Chinese Science|volume=11|pages=93–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the universe. The modern era of cosmology began with [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1915 [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]], which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name="Blandford"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A century of general relativity: Astrophysics and cosmology|author=Blandford R.

=== Mythologies ===
{{Main|Creation myth|Cosmogony|Religious cosmology}}
Many cultures have [[List of creation myths|stories describing the origin of the world and universe]]. Cultures generally regard these stories as having some [[truth]]. There are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those believing in a supernatural origin, ranging from a god directly creating the universe as it is now to a god just setting the "wheels in motion" (for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | quote="In common usage the word 'myth' refers to narratives or beliefs that are untrue or merely fanciful; the stories that make up national or ethnic mythologies describe characters and events that common sense and experience tell us are impossible. Nevertheless, all cultures celebrate such myths and attribute to them various degrees of literal or symbolic ''truth''." | last=Leeming | first=David A. | isbn=978-1-59884-174-9 | date=2010|page=xvii | title= Creation Myths of the World | publisher= ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnologists and anthropologists who study myths have developed various classification schemes for the various themes that appear in creation stories.&lt;ref name=Eliade1964&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Myth and Reality (Religious Traditions of the World)|date=1964|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-0-04-291001-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Scott A.|last2=McClure|first2=Michael|title=Myth and Knowing: An Introduction to World Mythology|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-7674-1957-4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a [[world egg]]; such stories include the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Kalevala]]'', the [[China|Chinese]] story of [[Pangu]] or the [[History of India|Indian]] [[Brahmanda Purana]]. In related stories, the universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the [[Tibetan Buddhism]] concept of [[Adi-Buddha]], the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother Earth), the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] goddess [[Coatlicue]] myth, the [[ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian]] [[Ennead|god]] [[Atum]] story, and the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Genesis creation narrative]] in which the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]] created the universe. In another type of story, the universe is created from the union of male and female deities, as in the [[Maori mythology|Maori story]] of [[Rangi and Papa]]. In other stories, the universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god—as from [[Tiamat]] in the [[Babylon]]ian epic ''[[Enuma Elish]]'' or from the giant [[Ymir]] in [[Norse mythology]]—or from chaotic materials, as in [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] in [[Japanese mythology]]. In other stories, the universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as [[Brahman]] and [[Prakrti]], the [[Serer creation myth|creation myth]] of the [[Serer people|Serers]],&lt;ref&gt;([[Henry Gravrand]], "La civilisation Sereer -Pangool") [in] [[Universität Frankfurt am Main]], Frobenius-Institut, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturmorphologie, Frobenius Gesellschaft, "Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Volumes 43–44", F. Steiner (1997), pp. 144–45, {{ISBN|3-515-02842-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[yin and yang]] of the [[Tao]].

=== Philosophical models ===
{{Further|Cosmology}}
{{See also|Pre-Socratic philosophy|Physics (Aristotle)|Hindu cosmology|Islamic cosmology|Philosophy of space and time}}
The [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic Greek philosophers]] and Indian philosophers developed some of the earliest philosophical concepts of the universe.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unfinished Universe|page=21|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=Louise|last=B. Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or ''[[arche]]''. The first to do so was [[Thales]], who proposed this material to be [[Water (classical element)|water]]. Thales' student, [[Anaximander]], proposed that everything came from the limitless ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''. [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] proposed the primordial material to be [[Air (classical element)|air]] on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the ''arche'' to condense or dissociate into different forms. [[Anaxagoras]] proposed the principle of ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind), while [[Heraclitus]] proposed [[fire (classical element)|fire]] (and spoke of ''[[logos]]''). [[Empedocles]] proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]] believed that all things were composed of [[number]], with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the [[Platonic solids]]. [[Democritus]], and later philosophers—most notably [[Leucippus]]—proposed that the universe is composed of indivisible [[atom]]s moving through a [[void (astronomy)|void]] ([[vacuum]]), although [[Aristotle]] did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers [[Drag (physics)|resistance to motion]]. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;

Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change, his contemporary [[Parmenides]] made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion, that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature. Parmenides denoted this reality as {{lang|grc|τὸ ἐν}} (The One). Parmenides' idea seemed implausible to many Greeks, but his student [[Zeno of Elea]] challenged them with several famous [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]]. Aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity, as well as the infinitely divisible continuum. Unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of time, he believed that the world is bounded by the celestial spheres and that cumulative stellar magnitude is only finitely multiplicative.

The [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], founder of the [[Vaisheshika]] school, developed a notion of [[atomism]] and proposed that [[light]] and [[heat]] were varieties of the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]], ''Our Oriental Heritage'': {{quote|"Two systems of Hindu thought propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika philosophy, held that the world is composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements. The [[Jainism|Jains]] more nearly approximated to [[Democritus]] by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations. Kanada believed light and heat to be varieties of the same substance; [[Udayana]] taught that all heat comes from the Sun; and [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vachaspati]], like [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD, the [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist atomist]] philosopher [[Dignāga]] proposed [[atom]]s to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Stcherbatsky, F. Th. (1930, 1962), ''Buddhist Logic'', Volume 1, p. 19, Dover, New York: {{quote|"The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... "Everything is evanescent",... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff... Both systems &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Samkhya|Sānkhya]], and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called "qualities" (''guna-dharma'') in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality,... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called ''guna'', "quality", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called ''dharmas'' ('qualities')."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of [[temporal finitism]] was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]], [[John Philoponus]], presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Muslim philosopher]], [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus); the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]], [[Saadia Gaon]] (Saadia ben Joseph); and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]], [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel).&lt;ref name=Viney1985&gt;{{cite book|title=Charles Hartshorne and the Existence of God|chapter=The Cosmological Argument|author=Donald Wayne Viney|pages=65–68|year=1985|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-87395-907-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomical concepts ===
{{Main|History of astronomy|Timeline of astronomy}}
[[File:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|right|3rd century BCE calculations by [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] on the relative sizes of, from left to right, the Sun, Earth, and Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy.]]

Astronomical models of the universe were proposed soon after [[astronomy]] began with the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]], who viewed the universe as a [[Flat Earth|flat disk]] floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps like those of [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].

Later [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers, observing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were concerned with developing models of the universe-based more profoundly on [[empirical evidence]]. The first coherent model was proposed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidos]]. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, [[celestial spheres]] eternally [[uniform circular motion|rotate with uniform motion]] around a stationary Earth. Normal [[classical elements|matter]] is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.

''[[De Mundo]]'' (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC), stated, "Five elements, situated in spheres in five regions, the less being in each case surrounded by the greater—namely, earth surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by ether—make up the whole universe".&lt;ref name=1908DeMundo&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/demundoarisrich |title=De Mundo |year=1914 |author=Aristotle |author2=Forster, E. S. |author3=Dobson, J. F. |page=[https://archive.org/details/demundoarisrich/page/2 2] |location=Oxford |publisher=The Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model was also refined by [[Callippus]] and after concentric spheres were abandoned, it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by [[Ptolemy]]. The success of such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]]). Other Greek scientists, such as the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean]] philosopher [[Philolaus]], postulated (according to [[Stobaeus]] account) that at the center of the universe was a "central fire" around which the [[Earth]], [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[Planet]]s revolved in uniform circular motion.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. (1968) [https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfMathematics ''A History of Mathematics'']. Wiley, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]] [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known individual to propose a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in [[Archimedes]]' book ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'' describes Aristarchus's heliocentric model. Archimedes wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You, King Gelon, are aware the universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why [[stellar parallax]] had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from [[Plutarch]] suggests (''On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Cleanthes]] [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the [[Stoics]]] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe [i.e. the Earth], ... supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the Earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flammarion engraving]], Paris 1888]]

The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], a [[Hellenistic astronomer]] who lived a century after Aristarchus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link=Otto E.

Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of [[tide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucio Russo]], ''Flussi e riflussi'', Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, {{ISBN|88-07-10349-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Strabo]] (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987|loc=p. 527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a [[Geometry|geometric]] model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, like what [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] later did in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987| loc=pp. 527–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] models were also proposed by the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] [[Aryabhata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987 | loc=pp. 529–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Islamic astronomy|Persian astronomers]] [[Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Albumasar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987 | loc=pp. 534–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al-Sijzi]].&lt;ref name=Nasr&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nasr |first=Seyyed H. |author-link=Hossein Nasr |orig-year=1964 |date=1993 |title=An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines |edition=2nd |publisher=1st edition by [[Harvard University Press]], 2nd edition by [[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=978-0-7914-1515-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontois00nasr/page/135 135–36] |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontois00nasr/page/135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThomasDiggesmap.JPG|thumb|left|[[Copernican heliocentrism|Model of the Copernican Universe]] by [[Thomas Digges]] in 1576, with the amendment that the stars are no longer confined to a sphere, but spread uniformly throughout the space surrounding the [[planet]]s.]]

The Aristotelian model was accepted in the [[Western world]] for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the [[Earth]] rotated on its axis and if the [[Sun]] were placed at the center of the universe.

{{quote|In the center rests the Sun. For who would place this lamp of a very beautiful temple in another or better place than this wherefrom it can illuminate everything at the same time?|Nicolaus Copernicus| in Chapter 10, Book 1 of ''De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestrum'' (1543)}}

As noted by Copernicus himself, the notion that the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] is very old, dating at least to [[Philolaus]] (c. 450 BC), [[Heraclides Ponticus]] (c. 350 BC) and [[Ecphantus the Pythagorean]]. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar [[Nicholas of Cusa]] also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, ''On Learned Ignorance'' (1440).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Misner|Misner, Thorne and Wheeler]], p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Sijzi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science in the Quran|volume=1|publisher=Malik Library|first=Ema Ākabara|last=Ālī|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. [[Empirical research|Empirical evidence]] for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of [[comet]]s, was given by [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Tusi]] (1201–1274) and [[Ali Qushji]] (1403–1474).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ragep |first=F.

In 1919, when the [[Hooker Telescope]] was completed, the prevailing view still was that the universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, [[Edwin Hubble]] identified [[Cepheid variable]]s in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]] and [[Triangulum Nebula|Triangulum]] among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that universe consists of a multitude of galaxies.&lt;ref name="SharovNovikov1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharov|first1=Aleksandr Sergeevich|last2=Novikov|first2=Igor Dmitrievich|title=Edwin Hubble, the discoverer of the big bang universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttEwkEdPc70C&amp;pg=PA34|access-date=December 31, 2011|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-41617-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

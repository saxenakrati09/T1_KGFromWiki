Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828,&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Tolstoy is best known for the novels ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1869) and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/facing-death-with-tolstoy |title=Facing death with Tolstoy |work=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Beard |first=Mary |date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; often cited as pinnacles of [[Literary realism|realist]] fiction.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, ''[[Childhood (Tolstoy novel)|Childhood]]'', ''[[Boyhood (novel)|Boyhood]]'', and ''[[Youth (Leo Tolstoy novel)|Youth]]'' (1852–1856), and ''[[Sevastopol Sketches]]'' (1855), based upon his experiences in the [[Crimean War]]. His fiction includes dozens of short stories and several [[novella]]s such as ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' (1886), ''[[Family Happiness]]'' (1859), and ''[[Hadji Murat (novel)|Hadji Murad]]'' (1912). He also wrote [[play (theater)|plays]] and numerous philosophical essays.

In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work ''[[A Confession]]'' (1882). His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of [[Jesus]], centering on the [[Sermon on the Mount]], caused him to become a fervent [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] and [[anarcho-pacifist|pacifist]].&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; His ideas on [[nonviolent resistance]], expressed in such works as ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' (1894), had a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as [[Mahatma Gandhi]]&lt;ref name="ResistNotEvil"&gt;[http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/opinion/Resist_Not.html Martin E.

== Origins ==
{{main|Tolstoy family}}
The [[Tolstoy family|Tolstoys]] were a well-known family of old [[Russian nobility]] who traced their ancestry to a mythical nobleman named Indris described by [[Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy|Pyotr Tolstoy]] as arriving "from Nemec, from the lands of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]" to [[Chernigov]] in 1353 along with his two sons Litvinos (or Litvonis) and Zimonten (or Zigmont) and a [[druzhina]] of 3000 people.&lt;ref name='rummel'&gt;''Vitold Rummel, Vladimir Golubtsov (1886)''.

Suvorin Publishing House, p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='bunin'&gt;[[Ivan Bunin]], ''The Liberation of Tolstoy: A Tale of Two Writers'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; While the word "Nemec" has been long used to describe [[Germans]] only, at that time it was applied to any foreigner who didn't speak Russian (from the word ''nemoy'' meaning ''mute'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovardalja.net/word.php?wordid=19618 Nemoy/Немой] word meaning from the [[Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language|Dahl's Explanatory Dictionary]] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Indris was then converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], under the name of Leonty, and his sons as Konstantin and Feodor. Konstantin's grandson Andrei Kharitonovich was nicknamed Tolstiy (translated as ''fat'') by [[Vasily II of Moscow]] after he moved from Chernigov to Moscow.&lt;ref name='rummel' /&gt;&lt;ref name='bunin' /&gt;

Because of the [[pagan]] names and the fact that Chernigov at the time was ruled by [[Demetrius I Starshy]] some researchers concluded that they were [[Lithuanians]] who arrived from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].&lt;ref name='rummel' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7kDJ3s1mcZcC&amp;q=tolstoy+lithuanian&amp;pg=PA8|title=Tolstoy|isbn=978-0-8021-3768-5|last1=Troyat|first1=Henri|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/books/six-centuries-of-tolstoys.html|title=Six Centuries of Tolstoys|date=6 November 1983|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Robinson|first1=Harlow}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, no mention of Indris was ever found in the 14th-to-16th-century documents, while the [[Old Russian Chronicles|Chernigov Chronicles]] used by Pyotr Tolstoy as a reference were lost.&lt;ref name='rummel' /&gt; The first documented members of the Tolstoy family also lived during the 17th century, thus Pyotr Tolstoy himself is generally considered the founder of the noble house, being granted the title of [[count]] by [[Peter the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://gerbovnik.ru/arms/162.html Tolstoy coat of arms] by All-Russian Armorials of Noble Houses of the Russian Empire.

== Life and career ==
[[File:Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy 1848.jpg|thumb|left|Tolstoy at age 20, {{circa}} 1848]]

Tolstoy was born at [[Yasnaya Polyana]], a family estate 12 kilometres (7.5&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of [[Tula, Russia]], and 200 kilometres (120&amp;nbsp;mi) south of [[Moscow]]. He was the fourth of five children of [[Count]] Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy (1794–1837), a veteran of the [[French invasion of Russia|Patriotic War of 1812]], and Countess Mariya Tolstaya (née Volkonskaya; 1790–1830). His mother died when he was two and his father when he was nine.&lt;ref name="AuthorDataSheet" /&gt; Tolstoy and his siblings were brought up by relatives.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; In 1844, he began studying law and oriental languages at [[Kazan University]], where teachers described him as "both unable and unwilling to learn".&lt;ref name="AuthorDataSheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillanreaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ads.leotolstoy.pdf |title=Author Data Sheet, Macmillan Readers |publisher=Macmillan Publishers Limited |access-date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy left the university in the middle of his studies,&lt;ref name="AuthorDataSheet" /&gt; returned to Yasnaya Polyana and then spent much time in Moscow, [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], leading a lax and leisurely lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; He began writing during this period,&lt;ref name="AuthorDataSheet" /&gt; including his first novel ''[[Childhood (Tolstoy novel)|Childhood]]'', a fictitious account of his own youth, which was published in 1852.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; In 1851, after running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasus]] and joined the [[Imperial Russian Army|army]]. Tolstoy served as a young artillery officer during the [[Crimean War]] and was in Sevastopol during the 11-month-long [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|siege of Sevastopol]] in 1854–55,&lt;ref name="BBCTen" /&gt; including the [[Battle of the Chernaya]]. During the war he was recognised for his courage and promoted to lieutenant.&lt;ref name="BBCTen"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3GL3DPct7D5GPQzB7GlrrBW/ten-things-you-didnt-know-about-tolstoy Ten Things You Didn't Know About Tolstoy]". BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appalled by the number of deaths involved in warfare,&lt;ref name="AuthorDataSheet" /&gt; and left the army after the end of the Crimean War.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

His experience in the army, and two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860–61 converted Tolstoy from a dissolute and privileged society author to a non-violent and spiritual [[Anarchism|anarchist]]. Others who followed the same path were [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]]. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that marked the rest of his life. In a letter to his friend [[Vasily Botkin]], Tolstoy wrote: "The truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed not only to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ... Henceforth, I shall never serve any government anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Wilson, ''Tolstoy'' (1988), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy's concept of [[non-violence]] or [[ahimsa]] was bolstered when he read a [[Tirukkural translations into German|German version]] of the [[Tirukkural]].&lt;ref name="PearlsOfInsp_Rajaram"&gt;{{cite book| last = Rajaram| first = M.| title = Thirukkural: Pearls of Inspiration| publisher = Rupa Publications| date = 2009| location = New Delhi | isbn = 978-81-291-1467-9| pages = xviii–xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later instilled the concept in [[Mahatma Gandhi]] through his [[A Letter to a Hindu]] when young Gandhi corresponded with him seeking his advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.online-literature.com/tolstoy/2733/| title = A Letter to A Hindu: The Subjection of India-Its Cause and Cure| last = Tolstoy| first = Leo| date = 14 December 1908| publisher = The Literature Network| access-date = 12 February 2012| quote = The Hindu Kural}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gandhi&gt;{{Citation| last = Parel| first = Anthony J.| author-link = Anthony Parel| contribution = Gandhi and Tolstoy|editor=M.P.

His European trip in 1860–61 shaped both his political and literary development when he met [[Victor Hugo]]. Tolstoy read Hugo's newly finished ''[[Les Misérables]]''. The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo's novel and Tolstoy's ''[[War and Peace]]'' indicates this influence. Tolstoy's political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Tolstoy reviewed Proudhon's forthcoming publication, ''La Guerre et la Paix'' ("''War and Peace''" in French), and later used the title for his masterpiece. The two men also discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: "If I recount this conversation with Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time."

Fired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for the children of Russia's peasants, who had just been [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipated from serfdom in 1861]]. Tolstoy described the schools' principles in his 1862 essay "The School at Yasnaya Polyana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tolstoy | first = Lev N. |author2=Leo Wiener |author3=translator and editor | title = The School at Yasnaya Polyana – The Complete Works of Count Tolstoy: Pedagogical Articles.

However, as a direct forerunner to [[A.S. Neill]]'s [[Summerhill School]], the school at Yasnaya Polyana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = A.N. | title = Tolstoy | publisher = W.W.

== Personal life ==
The death of his brother Nikolay in 1860 had an impact on Tolstoy, and led him to a desire to marry.&lt;ref name=AuthorDataSheet /&gt; On 23 September 1862, Tolstoy married [[Sophia Tolstaya|Sophia Andreevna Behrs]], who was sixteen years his junior and the daughter of a court physician. She was called Sonya, the Russian diminutive of Sofia, by her family and friends.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;Susan Jacoby, "The Wife of the Genius" (19 April 1981) ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; They had 13 children, eight of whom survived childhood:&lt;ref&gt;Feuer, Kathryn B.

* [[Alexandra Tolstaya|Countess Alexandra Lvovna Tolstaya]] (1884–1979)
* Count Ivan Lvovich Tolstoy (1888–1895)

The marriage was marked from the outset by sexual passion and emotional insensitivity when Tolstoy, on the eve of their marriage, gave her his diaries detailing his extensive sexual past and the fact that one of the serfs on his estate had borne him a son.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; Even so, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom and the support system to compose ''War and Peace'' and ''Anna Karenina'' with Sonya acting as his secretary, editor, and financial manager. Sonya was copying and hand-writing his epic works time after time. Tolstoy would continue editing ''War and Peace'' and had to have clean final drafts to be delivered to the publisher.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/W/bo20274891.html|title=War and Peace and Sonya|website=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, their later life together has been described by [[A.N. Wilson]] as one of the unhappiest in literary history. Tolstoy's relationship with his wife deteriorated as his beliefs became increasingly radical. This saw him seeking to reject his inherited and earned wealth, including the renunciation of the copyrights on his earlier works.

Some of the members of the Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Soviet Union]], and many of Leo Tolstoy's relatives and descendants today live in [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and the [[United States]]. Tolstoy's son, Count [[Lev Lvovich Tolstoy]], settled in Sweden and married a Swedish woman. Leo Tolstoy's last surviving grandchild, Countess [[Tatiana Tolstoy-Paus]], died in 2007 at [[Herresta]] manor in Sweden, which is owned by Tolstoy's descendants.&lt;ref&gt;"Tanja Paus och Sonja Ceder till minne," ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', 11 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish jazz singer [[Viktoria Tolstoy]] is also descended from Leo Tolstoy.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Puzin, ''The Lev Tolstoy House-Museum In Yasnaya Polyana'' (with a list of Leo Tolstoy's descendants), 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his great-great-grandsons, Vladimir Tolstoy (born 1962), is a director of the [[Yasnaya Polyana]] museum since 1994 and an adviser to the [[President of Russia]] on cultural affairs since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ypmuseum.ru/en/2011-04-13-17-30-44/mhistory/65-2011-08-19-09-30-03.html Vladimir Ilyich Tolstoy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223225741/http://ypmuseum.ru/en/2011-04-13-17-30-44/mhistory/65-2011-08-19-09-30-03.html |date=23 February 2019 }} at the official [[Yasnaya Polyana]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.kremlin.ru/catalog/persons/311/biography|title=Persons ∙ Directory ∙ President of Russia|website=President of Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilya Tolstoy]]'s great-grandson, [[Pyotr Olegovich Tolstoy|Pyotr Tolstoy]], is a well-known Russian journalist and TV presenter as well as a [[7th State Duma|State Duma]] deputy since 2016. His cousin Fyokla Tolstaya (born Anna Tolstaya in 1971), daughter of the acclaimed Soviet [[Slavist]] Nikita Tolstoy ([[:ru:Толстой, Никита Ильич|ru]]) (1923–1996), is also a Russian journalist, TV and radio host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvkultura.ru/brand/show/brand_id/45825/|title=Толстые / Телеканал "Россия – Культура"|website=tvkultura.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Novels and fictional works ==
[[File:Leo Tolstoy 1897, black and white, 37767u.jpg|thumb|Tolstoy in 1897]]
Tolstoy is considered one of the giants of Russian literature; his works include the novels ''[[War and Peace]]'' and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' and novellas such as ''[[Hadji Murat (novel)|Hadji Murad]]'' and ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''.

Tolstoy's earliest works, the autobiographical novels [[Childhood (Tolstoy novel)|''Childhood'']], [[Boyhood (novel)|''Boyhood'']], and [[Youth (Tolstoy novel)|''Youth'']] (1852–1856), tell of a rich landowner's son and his slow realization of the chasm between himself and his peasants. Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy's own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up.

Tolstoy served as a [[second lieutenant]] in an artillery regiment during the [[Crimean War]], recounted in his ''[[Sevastopol Sketches]]''. His experiences in battle helped stir his subsequent [[pacifism]] and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.&lt;ref&gt;''Government is Violence: essays on anarchism and pacifism''. Leo Tolstoy – 1990 – Phoenix Press&lt;/ref&gt;

His fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived.&lt;ref&gt;''Tolstoy: the making of a novelist. E'' Crankshaw – 1974 – Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Cossacks (novel)|The Cossacks]]'' (1863) describes the [[Cossack]] life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl. ''Anna Karenina'' (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in ''War and Peace'', Levin in ''Anna Karenina'' and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in ''Resurrection''.

''War and Peace'' is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], from the court of [[Alexander I of Russia]] to the battlefields of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]]. Tolstoy's original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the [[Decembrist revolt]], to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that [[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Andrei Bolkonsky]]'s son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy's theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider ''War and Peace'' to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy and the Development of Realism. G Lukacs. ''Marxists on Literature: An Anthology'', London: Penguin, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; ''War and Peace'' (which is to Tolstoy really an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that ''Anna Karenina'' was his first true novel.&lt;ref&gt;''Tolstoy and the Novel''. J Bayley – 1967 – Chatto &amp; Windus&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Anna Karenina'', Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'' (1886) and ''[[What Is to Be Done? (Tolstoy)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' develop a radical [[anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifist]] Christian philosophy which led to his [[excommunication]] from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;''Church and State''. L Tolstoy&amp;nbsp;– On Life and Essays on Religion, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; For all the praise showered on ''Anna Karenina'' and ''War and Peace'', Tolstoy rejected the two works later in his life as something not as true of reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Women in Tolstoy: the ideal and the erotic'' R.C. Benson – 1973 – University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'', Tolstoy attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church. Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of [[Georgism]], of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life.

Tolstoy also tried himself in poetry with several soldier songs written during his military service and fairy tales in verse such as ''Volga-bogatyr'' and ''Oaf'' stylized as national folk songs. They were written between 1871 and 1874 for his ''Russian Book for Reading'', a collection of short stories in four volumes (total of 629 stories in various genres) published along with the ''New Azbuka'' textbook and addressed to schoolchildren. Nevertheless, he was skeptical about poetry as a genre. As he famously said, "Writing poetry is like ploughing and dancing at the same time". According to [[Valentin Bulgakov]], he criticised poets, including [[Alexander Pushkin]], for their "false" epithets used "simply to make it rhyme".&lt;ref&gt;''Leo Tolstoy (1874)''.

== Critical appraisal by other authors ==
Tolstoy's contemporaries paid him lofty tributes. [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], who died thirty years before Tolstoy, admired and was delighted by Tolstoy's novels (and, conversely, Tolstoy also admired Dostoyevsky's work).&lt;ref name="Dosteoevsky"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Lyubov Dostoevskaya|Aimée Dostoyevskaya]] | year = 1921  | title = Fyodor Dostoyevsky: A Study| location =  Honolulu, Hawaii| publisher = University Press of the Pacific  | page = https://books.google.es/books?id=n7fb7eH6nRUC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=dostoyevsky+admired+tolstoy&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj30sbFpsvpAhWLA2MBHZLrDAYQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dostoyevsky%20admired%20tolstoy&amp;f=false p. 218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gustave Flaubert]], on reading a translation of ''War and Peace'', exclaimed, "What an artist and what a psychologist!" [[Anton Chekhov]], who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, "When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature." The 19th-century British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] opined that "A novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life."&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

Later novelists continued to appreciate Tolstoy's art, but sometimes also expressed criticism. [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote "I am attracted by his earnestness and by his power of detail, but I am repelled by his looseness of construction and by his unreasonable and impracticable mysticism."&lt;ref name="ACD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Arthur Conan|title=My Favourite Novelist and His Best Book|date= January 1898|location=London|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1306981h.html|access-date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Woolf]] declared him "the greatest of all novelists."&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; [[James Joyce]] noted that "He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!" [[Thomas Mann]] wrote of Tolstoy's seemingly guileless artistry: "Seldom did art work so much like nature." [[Vladimir Nabokov]] heaped superlatives upon ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' and ''Anna Karenina''; he questioned, however, the reputation of ''War and Peace'', and sharply criticized ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' and ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]''.

[[File:Ilya Repin - Leo Tolstoy Barefoot - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Tolstoy dressed in peasant clothing, by [[Ilya Repin]] (1901)]]

After reading [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes. In 1869 he writes: "Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy's Letter to A.A. Fet, 30 August 1869&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chapter VI of ''[[A Confession]]'', Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer's work. It explains how a complete [[self-denial|denial of self]] causes only a relative nothingness which is not to be feared. Tolstoy was struck by the description of Christian, [[Buddhist]], and [[Hindu]] ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer's ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will: &lt;blockquote&gt; But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for [[eternal salvation]] is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior ([[Matthew 19:24]]): "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." Therefore, those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose [[simple living|voluntary poverty]] when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus [[Buddha]] [[Sakyamuni]] was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant's staff; and [[Francis of Assisi]], the founder of the [[mendicant orders]] who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: "Now Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?" and who replied: "I have made a far more beautiful choice!" "Whom?" "''La povertà'' (poverty)": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. II, §&amp;nbsp;170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called ''What I Believe'', in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in [[Jesus Christ]]'s [[Teachings of Jesus|teachings]] and was particularly influenced by the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and the injunction to [[turn the other cheek]], which he understood as a "commandment of non-resistance to evil by force" and a doctrine of [[pacifism]] and [[nonviolence]]. In his work ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'', he explains that he considered mistaken the Church's doctrine because they had made a "perversion" of Christ's teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American [[Quakers]] who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as [[George Fox]], [[William Penn]] and [[Jonathan Dymond]]. Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the apparently inevitable waging of war by governments, is why he is considered a philosophical anarchist.

Later, various versions of "Tolstoy's Bible" were published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.&lt;ref&gt;Orwin, Donna T. ''The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy''. Cambridge University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gandhi Tolstoy Farm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]] and other residents of [[Tolstoyan movement#Africa|Tolstoy Farm]], South Africa, 1910]]

Tolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner perfection through following the [[Great Commandment]] of loving one's neighbor and God, rather than guidance from the Church or state. Another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ's teachings is [[nonresistance]] during conflict. This idea in Tolstoy's ''book [[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' (full text of English translation [[s:The Kingdom of God Is Within You|available on Wikisource]]) directly influenced [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and therefore also nonviolent resistance movements to this day.

Tolstoy believed that the aristocracy was a burden on the poor, and that the only way to live together is [[Christian anarchism|anarchism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} He opposed [[private property|private]] land ownership&lt;ref&gt;I Cannot Be Silent.

Tolstoy's passion from the depth of his austere moral views is reflected in his later work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=editor on |url=http://coastlinejournal.com/2009/09/08/why-leo-tolstoy-wouldn%E2%80%99t-super-size-it/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123060912/http://coastlinejournal.com/2009/09/08/why-leo-tolstoy-wouldn%E2%80%99t-super-size-it/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 November 2017 |title=Sommers, Aaron (2009) ''Why Leo Tolstoy Wouldn't Supersize It'' |publisher=Coastlinejournal.com |date=8 September 2009 |access-date=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the sequence of the temptation of Sergius in ''Father Sergius''. Gorky relates how Tolstoy once read this passage before him and Chekhov and Tolstoy was moved to tears by the end of the reading. Later passages of rare power include the personal crises faced by the protagonists of ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'', and of ''[[Master and Man (short story)|Master and Man]]'', where the main character in the former and the reader in the latter are made aware of the foolishness of the protagonists' lives.

Tolstoy had a profound influence on the development of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/TheContemporaryRelevanceOfLeoTolstoy |title=The Contemporary Relevance of Leo Tolstoy's Late Political Thought |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |author-link=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2009|quote=Tolstoy articulated his Christian anarchist political thought between 1880 and 1910, yet its continuing relevance should have become fairly self-evident already.|publisher=International Political Science Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tolstoyan]]s were a small Christian anarchist group formed by Tolstoy's companion, [[Vladimir Chertkov]] (1854–1936), to spread Tolstoy's religious teachings. Philosopher [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the ''[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Petr Chelčický|Chojecki]], [[Hans Denck|Denk]] and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[property right]]s, deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason. With all the might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'') a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law altogether, and especially of the present [[property law]]s. He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Kropotkin |year=1911 |publisher= New York : Encyclopaedia Britannica|page=918 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri01chisrich#page/918/mode/2up |quote=Anarchism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In hundreds of essays over the last 20 years of his life, Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by [[Kropotkin]] and [[Proudhon]] to his readers, while rejecting anarchism's espousal of [[propaganda of the deed|violent revolutionary means]]. In the 1900 essay, "On Anarchy", he wrote: "The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution—a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man." Despite his misgivings about [[anarchist violence]], Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of [[anarchism in Russia|anarchist thinkers in Russia]], and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's "Words of a Rebel", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peter Kropotkin: From Prince to Rebel]]''.

However, anarchist versions of Georgism have been proposed since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-state.com/geo/foldvary1.html|title=Geoanarchism|author-link=Fred E. Foldvary|first=Fred E.|last=Foldvary|access-date=15 April 2009|date=15 July 2001|publisher=anti-state.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy's 1899 novel ''Resurrection'' explores his thoughts on Georgism and hints that Tolstoy had such a view. It suggests small communities with local governance to manage the collective land rents for common goods, while still heavily criticising [[Sovereign state|state]] institutions such as the [[justice system]].

== Death ==
[[File:Tula YasnayaPolyana asv2019-09 img12 LNTolstoy grave.jpg|thumb|right|Tolstoy's grave with flowers at [[Yasnaya Polyana]]]]

Tolstoy died in 1910, aged 82. Just before his death, his health was a concern of his family, who cared for him daily. In his last days, he spoke and wrote about dying. Renouncing his aristocratic lifestyle, he left home one winter night.&lt;ref&gt;''The last days of Tolstoy''. VG Chertkov. 1922. Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; His secretive departure was an apparent attempt to escape from his wife's tirades. She spoke out against many of his teachings, and in recent years had grown envious of his attention to [[Tolstoyan movement|Tolstoyan]] "disciples".

Tolstoy died of [[pneumonia]]&lt;ref&gt;''Leo Tolstoy''. EJ Simmons – 1946 – Little, Brown and Company&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Lev Tolstoy (rural locality)|Astapovo]] railway station, after a day's train journey south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n14/james-meek/some-wild-creature|title=James Meek reviews 'The Death of Tolstoy' by William Nickell, 'The Diaries of Sofia Tolstoy' translated by Cathy Porter, 'A Confession' by Leo Tolstoy, translated by Anthony Briggs and 'Anniversary Essays on Tolstoy' by Donna Tussing Orwin · LRB 22 July 2010|pages=3–8|newspaper=London Review of Books|date=22 July 2010|last1=Meek|first1=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station master took Tolstoy to his apartment, and his personal doctors arrived and gave him injections of [[morphine]] and [[camphor]].

The police tried to limit access to his funeral procession, but thousands of peasants lined the streets. Still, some were heard to say that, other than knowing that "some nobleman had died", they knew little else about Tolstoy.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstaya, S.A. ''The Diaries of Sophia Tolstoy'', Book Sales, 1987; Chertkov, V. "The Last Days of Leo Tolstoy," http://www.linguadex.com/tolstoy/index.html, translated by Benjamin Scher&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources, Tolstoy spent the last hours of his life preaching love, non-violence, and [[Georgism]] to fellow passengers on the train.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth C. Wenzer, "Tolstoy's Georgist spiritual political economy: anarchism and land reform – 1897–1910", Special Issue: Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the Death of Henry George, ''The American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', Oct 1997; http://www.ditext.com/wenzer/tolstoy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== In films ==
A 2009 film about Tolstoy's final year, ''[[The Last Station]]'', based on the 1990 novel by [[Jay Parini]], was made by director [[Michael Hoffman (American director)|Michael Hoffman]] with [[Christopher Plummer]] as Tolstoy and [[Helen Mirren]] as Sofya Tolstoya. Both performers were nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscars]] for their roles. There have been other films about the writer, including ''[[Departure of a Grand Old Man]]'', made in 1912 just two years after his death, ''How Fine, How Fresh the Roses Were'' (1913), and ''Leo Tolstoy'', directed by and starring [[Sergei Gerasimov (film director)|Sergei Gerasimov]] in 1984.

There is also a famous [[lost film]] of Tolstoy made a decade before he died. In 1901, the American travel lecturer [[Burton Holmes]] visited Yasnaya Polyana with [[Albert J. Beveridge]], the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge's advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that the meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge's chances of running for the U.S. presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Irving, 'Everybody's Rover Boy', in ''The Sunday Gentleman''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1965. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

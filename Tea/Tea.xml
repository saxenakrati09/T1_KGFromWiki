'''Tea''' is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] or fresh [[leaves]] of the ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'', an [[evergreen]] [[shrub]] native to [[East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.&lt;ref name="Macfarlane"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Alan |last1=Macfarlane |author-link=Alan Macfarlane |last2=Macfarlane |first2=Iris |author-link2=Iris Macfarlane |title=The Empire of Tea |publisher=The Overlook Press |isbn=978-1-58567-493-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/empireoftearemar00macf/page/32 32] |year=2004 |url=https://archive.org/details/empireoftearemar00macf/page/32}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of tea; some, like [[Darjeeling tea|Darjeeling]] and [[Green tea|Chinese greens]], have a cooling, slightly bitter, and [[astringent]] flavour,&lt;ref name="ody"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Penelope Ody |title=Complete Guide to Medicinal Herbs |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |location=New York |year= 2000|page=48 |isbn=978-0-7894-6785-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy [[Note (perfumery)|notes]].

The term [[herbal tea]] refers to drinks not made from ''Camellia sinensis'': [[infusion]]s of fruit, leaves, or [[Plant anatomy|other parts of the plant]], such as [[steeping|steeps]] of [[Rose hip|rosehip]], [[chamomile]], or [[rooibos]]. These may be called ''tisanes'' or ''herbal infusions'' to prevent confusion with "tea" made from the tea plant.

== Origin and history ==
{{further|History of tea}}
===Botanical origin===
Tea plants are native to East Asia and probably originated in the borderlands of north Burma and southwestern China.&lt;ref name=Yamamoto /&gt;

Chinese (small-leaf) type tea (''C. sinensis'' var. ''sinensis'') may have originated in southern China possibly with hybridization of unknown wild tea relatives. However, since there are no known wild populations of this tea, its origin is speculative.&lt;ref name="Meegahakumbura 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meegahakumbura 2"/&gt;

Given their genetic differences forming distinct [[clade]]s, Chinese Assam-type tea (''C. sinensis'' var. ''assamica'') may have two different parentages – one being found in southern [[Yunnan]] ([[Xishuangbanna]], [[Pu'er City]]) and the other in western Yunnan ([[Lincang]], [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]]). Many types of Southern Yunnan Assam tea have been hybridized with the closely related species ''[[Camellia taliensis]]''. Unlike Southern Yunnan Assam tea, Western Yunnan Assam tea shares many genetic similarities with Indian Assam-type tea (also ''C. sinensis'' var. ''assamica''). Thus, Western Yunnan Assam tea and Indian Assam tea both may have originated from the same parent plant in the area where southwestern China, Indo-Burma, and Tibet meet. However, as the Indian Assam tea shares no [[haplotype]]s with Western Yunnan Assam tea, Indian Assam tea is likely to have originated from an independent domestication. Some Indian Assam tea appears to have hybridized with the species ''[[Camellia pubicosta]]''.&lt;ref name="Meegahakumbura 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meegahakumbura |first1=MK |last2=Wambulwa |first2=MC |last3=Thapa |first3=KK |display-authors=etal |year=2016 |title=Indications for three independent domestication events for the tea plant (''Camellia sinensis'' (L.)

Assuming a generation of 12 years, Chinese small-leaf tea is estimated to have diverged from Assam tea around 22,000 years ago, while Chinese Assam tea and Indian Assam tea diverged 2,800 years ago. The divergence of Chinese small-leaf tea and Assam tea would correspond to the last [[Ice age|glacial maximum]].&lt;ref name="Meegahakumbura 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meegahakumbura 2"/&gt;

===Early tea drinking===
[[File:Shinno (Shennong) derivative.jpg|thumb|upright|A 19th-century Japanese painting depicting [[Shennong]]: Chinese legends credit Shennong with the invention of tea.&lt;ref name="laura2" /&gt;]]
Tea drinking may have begun in the region of Yunnan region, where it was used for medicinal purposes. It is also believed that in [[Sichuan]], "people began to boil tea leaves for consumption into a concentrated liquid without the addition of other leaves or herbs, thereby using tea as a bitter yet stimulating drink, rather than as a medicinal concoction."{{sfn|Heiss|Heiss|2007|pp=6–7}}

Chinese legends attribute the invention of tea to the mythical [[Shennong]] (in central and northern China) in 2737 BC, although evidence suggests that tea drinking may have been introduced from the southwest of China (Sichuan/Yunnan area).&lt;ref name="laura2"&gt;{{Citation| last = Yee| first = L.K.| title = Tea's Wonderful History| publisher = The Chinese Historical and Cultural Project| quote=year 1996–2012| url = http://www.chcp.org/tea.html| access-date = 17 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020803115304/http://chcp.org/tea.html |archive-date=3 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest written records of tea come from China.

===Developments===
[[File:Tea with ingredients.jpg|thumb|right|Tea with ingredients, China]]
Through the centuries, a variety of techniques for processing tea, and a number of different forms of tea, were developed. During the Tang dynasty, tea was steamed, then pounded and shaped into cake form,{{sfn|Mair|Hoh|2009|pp=39–41}} while in the [[Song dynasty]], loose-leaf tea was developed and became popular. During the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, unoxidized tea leaves were first pan-fried, then rolled and dried, a process that stops the [[Redox|oxidation]] process that turns the leaves dark, thereby allowing tea to remain green. In the 15th century, [[oolong]] tea, in which the leaves were allowed to partially oxidize before pan-frying, was developed.{{sfn|Benn|2015|p=42}} Western tastes, however, favoured the fully oxidized [[black tea]], and the leaves were allowed to oxidize further. [[Yellow tea]] was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently careless practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, which yielded a different flavour.{{sfn|Mair|Hoh|2009|p=118}}

As a gift to the tsar, he was given 250 pounds of tea. Starkov at first refused, seeing no use for a load of dead leaves, but the Khan insisted. Thus was tea introduced to Russia. In 1679, Russia concluded a treaty on regular tea supplies from [[China]] via [[camel train|camel caravan]] in exchange for furs. It is today considered the ''de facto'' national beverage.

''assamica,'' used in [[Pu'er tea|Pu-erh]] and most Indian teas (but not Darjeeling). Within these botanical varieties, many [[strain (biology)|strains]] and modern clonal varieties are known. Leaf size is the chief criterion for the classification of tea plants, with three primary classifications being:&lt;ref name=Mondal /&gt; [[Assam tea|Assam]] type, characterised by the largest leaves; China type, characterised by the smallest leaves; and Cambodian type, characterised by leaves of intermediate size. The Cambodian-type tea (''C. assamica'' subsp. ''lasiocaly'') was originally considered a type of Assam tea.

Pests that can afflict tea plants include mosquito bugs, genus ''[[Helopeltis]]'', which are [[hemiptera|true bugs]] and not to be confused with [[mosquito|dipterous insects of family ''Culicidae'']] ('mosquitos'). Mosquito bugs can damage leaves both by sucking plant materials, and by the laying of eggs (oviposition) within the plant. Spraying with synthetic [[insecticide]]s may be deemed appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Somnath Roy, Narayanannair Muraleedharan, Ananda Mukhapadhyay &amp; Gautam Handique | date = 24 Apr 2015 | title =  The tea mosquito bug, Helopeltis theivora Waterhouse (Heteroptera: Miridae): its status, biology, ecology and management in tea plantations | journal = International Journal of Pest Management, 61:3 | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 179–197 | doi = 10.1080/09670874.2015.1030002 | s2cid = 83481846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pests are [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on Camellia|Lepidopteran]] leaf feeders and various [[List of tea diseases|tea diseases]].

Physically speaking, tea has properties of both a solution and a suspension. It is a solution of all the water-soluble compounds that have been extracted from the tea leaves, such as the polyphenols and amino acids, but is a suspension when all of the insoluble components are considered, such as the cellulose in the tea leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://teatropolitan.wordpress.com/2008/11/21/tea-chemistry/ |title=Tea Chemistry |last=Shoane |first=John |date=2008-11-21 |website=The Teatropolitan Times |access-date=2016-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221180255/https://teatropolitan.wordpress.com/2008/11/21/tea-chemistry/ |archive-date=21 December 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processing and classification ==
{{main|Tea processing}}
[[File:Tea in different grade of fermentation.jpg|thumb|Teas of different levels of oxidation (L to R): green, yellow, oolong, and black]]

Tea is generally divided into categories based on how it is processed.&lt;ref name="LiuTong"&gt;{{cite book |author=Liu Tong |title=Chinese tea |publisher= China Intercontinental Press|location=Beijing|year=2005|page=137 |isbn=978-7-5085-0835-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least six different types are produced:
* [[white tea|White]]: wilted and unoxidized;
* [[yellow tea|Yellow]]: unwilted and unoxidized but allowed to yellow;
* [[green tea|Green]]: unwilted and unoxidized;
* [[Oolong]]: wilted, bruised, and partially oxidized;
* [[Black tea|Black]]: wilted, sometimes crushed, and fully oxidized (called {{lang|zh|紅茶}} [''hóngchá''], "red tea" in Chinese and other East Asian tea culture);
* [[Fermented tea|Post-fermented (Dark)]]: green tea that has been allowed to ferment/compost (called {{lang|zh|黑茶}} [''hēichá''] "black tea" in Chinese tea culture).

After picking, the leaves of ''C. sinensis'' soon begin to [[Wilting|wilt]] and [[Redox|oxidize]] unless immediately dried. An [[Food browning|enzymatic oxidation]] process triggered by the plant's intracellular [[enzyme]]s causes the leaves to turn progressively darker as their [[chlorophyll]] breaks down and tannins are released. This darkening is stopped at a predetermined stage by heating, which deactivates the enzymes responsible. In the production of black teas, halting by heating is carried out simultaneously with drying. Without careful moisture and temperature control during manufacture and packaging, growth of undesired molds and bacteria may make tea unfit for consumption.

=== Additional processing and additives ===
{{further|Tea blending and additives}}
[[File:Teaprocessing.svg|thumb|right|Common processing methods of tea leaves]]
After basic processing, teas may be altered through additional processing steps before being sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tea: a user's guide |last=Tony |first=Gebely |isbn=978-0-9981030-0-6 |pages=Chapter 6 |oclc=965904874 |date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often consumed with additions to the basic tea leaf and water added during preparation or drinking. Examples of additional processing steps that occur before tea is sold are blending, flavouring, scenting, and decaffeination of teas. Examples of additions added at the point of consumption include milk, sugar and lemon.

Tea blending is the combination of different teas together to achieve the final product. Such teas may combine others from the same cultivation area or several different ones. The aim is to obtain consistency, better taste, higher price, or some combination of the three.

Flavoured and scented teas add aromas and flavours to the base tea. This can be accomplished through directly adding flavouring agents, such as [[ginger]], [[clove]]s, [[Lamiaceae|mint leaves]], [[cardamom]], [[bergamot orange|bergamot]] (found in [[Earl Grey tea|Earl Grey]]), [[vanilla]], and [[spearmint]]. Alternatively, because tea easily retains odours, it can be placed in proximity to an aromatic ingredient to absorb its aroma, as in traditional [[jasmine tea]].&lt;ref&gt;Gong, Wen.

[[File:Nice Cup of Tea.jpg|thumb|Black tea is often taken with milk]]
The addition of milk to tea in Europe was first mentioned in 1680 by the epistolist [[Madame de Sévigné]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briefguides.co.uk/content/tea.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822093059/http://www.briefguides.co.uk/content/tea.php |archive-date=22 August 2006 |title=Brief Guide to Tea |publisher=BriefGuides |year=2006 |access-date=7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many teas are traditionally drunk with milk in cultures where dairy products are consumed. These include Indian [[masala chai]] and British tea blends. These teas tend to be very hearty varieties of black tea which can be tasted through the milk, such as Assams, or the East Friesian blend. Milk is thought to neutralise remaining tannins and reduce acidity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-9164614 "Some tea and wine may cause cancer – tannin, found in tea and red wine, linked to esophageal cancer"], ''Nutrition Health Review'', 22 September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Way of Herbs |last=Tierra |first=Michael |year=1990 |publisher=Pocket Books |isbn=978-0-671-72403-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/wayofherbsfullyu00tier}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Han Chinese]] do not usually drink milk with tea but the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] do, and the elite of the Qing Dynasty of the Chinese Empire continued to do so. [[Hong Kong-style milk tea]] is based on British habits. [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] and other Himalayan peoples traditionally drink tea with milk or [[yak butter]] and salt. In Eastern European countries, Russia and Italy, tea is commonly served with lemon juice. In Poland, tea is traditionally served with a slice of lemon and is sweetened with either sugar or honey; tea with milk is called a ''bawarka'' ("[[Bavaria]]n style") in [[Polish language|Polish]] and is also widely popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://glosbe.com/ |title=Bawarka in English, translation, Polish-English Dictionary |website=Glosbe |access-date=12 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224121219/https://glosbe.com/ |archive-date=24 December 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, tea with milk is known as "white tea".

The order of steps in preparing a cup of tea is a much-debated topic and can vary widely between cultures or even individuals. Some say it is preferable to add the milk to the cup before the tea, as the high temperature of freshly brewed tea can denature the proteins found in fresh milk, similar to the change in taste of [[UHT|UHT milk]], resulting in an inferior-tasting beverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3016342.stm |title=How to make a perfect cuppa |work=[[BBC News]] |date=25 June 2003 |access-date=28 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722010957/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3016342.stm |archive-date=22 July 2006 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others insist it is better to add the milk to the cup after the tea, as black tea is often brewed as close to boiling as possible. The addition of milk chills the beverage during the crucial brewing phase, if brewing in a cup rather than using a pot, meaning the delicate flavour of a good tea cannot be fully appreciated. By adding the milk afterwards, it is easier to dissolve sugar in the tea and also to ensure the desired amount of milk is added, as the colour of the tea can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2000/02/03/97177.htm |title=Biscuit Dunking Physics |first=Karl S. |last=Kruszelnicki |date=3 February 2000 |website=www.abc.net.au |access-date=12 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611155916/http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2000/02/03/97177.htm |archive-date=11 June 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the order of steps was taken as an indication of class: only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality porcelain would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling water unadulterated with milk.&lt;ref name="Dubrin2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dubrin, Beverly |title=Tea Culture: History, Traditions, Celebrations, Recipes &amp; More |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMcNCwcCPpgC&amp;pg=PA24 |year=2010 |publisher=Charlesbridge Publishing |isbn=978-1-60734-363-9 |page=24 |access-date=10 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506052427/https://books.google.com/books?id=WMcNCwcCPpgC&amp;pg=PA24 |archive-date=6 May 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher temperature difference means faster [[heat transfer]], so the earlier milk is added, the slower the drink cools.

Drinking tea is often believed to result in calm alertness; {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} it contains [[L-theanine]], [[theophylline]], and bound caffeine&lt;ref name="ody" /&gt; (sometimes called ''[[theine]]''). [[Decaffeinated]] brands are also sold. While herbal teas are also referred to as tea, most of them do not contain leaves from the tea plant. While tea is the second most consumed beverage on Earth after water, in many cultures it is also consumed at elevated social events, such as the [[tea party]].

[[Tea ceremony|Tea ceremonies]] have arisen in different cultures, such as the [[Chinese tea culture|Chinese]] and [[Japanese tea ceremony|Japanese]] traditions, each of which employ certain techniques and ritualised protocol of brewing and serving tea for enjoyment in a refined setting.

In central and southern Punjab and the metropolitan Sindh region of Pakistan, tea with milk and sugar (sometimes with pistachios, cardamom, etc.), commonly referred to as ''chai'', is widely consumed. It is the most common beverage of households in the region. In the northern Pakistani regions of [[Chitral]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], a salty, buttered [[Butter tea|Tibetan-style tea]] is consumed.[[File:South Indian tea (5399611578).jpg|thumb|[[Indian tea culture|Indian tea]]]]

It is sometimes served with biscuits to be dipped in the tea and eaten before consuming the tea. More often than not, it is drunk in "doses" of small cups (referred to as "cutting" chai if sold at street tea vendors) rather than one large cup.

In Burma (Myanmar), tea is consumed not only as hot drinks, but also as sweet tea and green tea known locally as ''laphet-yay'' and ''laphet-yay-gyan'', respectively. Pickled tea leaves, known locally as ''[[lahpet]]'', are also a national delicacy. Pickled tea is usually eaten with roasted sesame seeds, crispy fried beans, roasted peanuts and fried garlic chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTk20rPq1dUC |title=Burma: Rivers of Flavor |first=Naomi |last=Duguid |isbn=978-1-57965-413-9 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mali, [[gunpowder tea]] is served in series of three, starting with the highest oxidisation or strongest, unsweetened tea, locally referred to as "strong like death", followed by a second serving, where the same tea leaves are boiled again with some sugar added ("pleasant as life"), and a third one, where the same tea leaves are boiled for the third time with yet more sugar added ("sweet as love"). Green tea is the central ingredient of a distinctly Malian custom, the "Grin", an informal social gathering that cuts across social and economic lines, starting in front of family compound gates in the afternoons and extending late into the night, and is widely popular in [[Bamako]] and other large urban areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

{{See also|List of countries by tea consumption per capita}}
Tea is the most popular manufactured drink consumed in the world, equaling all others – including coffee, soft drinks, and alcohol&amp;nbsp;– combined.&lt;ref name="Macfarlane" /&gt; Most tea consumed outside East Asia is produced on large plantations in the hilly regions of India and Sri Lanka and is destined to be sold to large businesses. Opposite this large-scale industrial production are many small "gardens," sometimes minuscule plantations, that produce highly sought-after teas prized by gourmets. These teas are both rare and expensive and can be compared to some of the most expensive wines in this respect.

India is the world's largest tea-drinking nation,&lt;ref name=Sanyal /&gt; although the per capita consumption of tea remains a modest {{convert|750|g|oz}} per person every year. Turkey, with {{convert|2.5|kg|lboz}} of tea consumed per person per year, is the world's greatest per capita consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketresearchworld.net/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=208 |title=Turkey: Second biggest tea market in the world |date=13 May 2013 |access-date=25 November 2012 |author=Euromonitor International |work=Market Research World |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117000057/http://www.marketresearchworld.net/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=208 |archive-date=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Packaging ==

=== Tea bags ===
[[File:Tea bags.jpg|thumb|Tea bags]]
{{main|Tea bag}}
In 1907, American tea merchant Thomas Sullivan began distributing samples of his tea in small bags of silk with a drawstring. Consumers noticed they could simply leave the tea in the bag and reuse it with fresh tea. However, the potential of this distribution and packaging method would not be fully realised until later on. During World War II, tea was rationed in the United Kingdom. In 1953, after [[Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II|rationing in the UK]] ended, [[Tetley]] launched the tea bag to the UK, and it was an immediate success.

The "pyramid tea bag" (or sachet), introduced by Lipton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lipton.com/en_en/jane-1,180.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430040636/http://www.lipton.com/en_en/jane-1%2C180.aspx |archive-date=30 April 2011 |title=Lipton Institute of Tea – Interview of Steve, Tea technology manager, Chapter: A Culture of Innovation |publisher=Lipton |year=2008 |access-date=26 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and PG Tips/Scottish Blend in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PG Tips – About Us |url=http://www.pgtips.co.uk/aboutus/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120162321/http://www.pgtips.co.uk/aboutus/|archive-date=20 January 2007 |access-date=17 February 2009 |work=pgtips.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to address one of the connoisseurs' arguments against paper tea bags by way of its three-dimensional [[tetrahedron]] shape, which allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} However, some types of pyramid tea bags have been criticised as being environmentally unfriendly, since their synthetic material is not as biodegradable as loose tea leaves and paper tea bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Most UK teabags not fully biodegradeable, research reveals |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/02/teabags-biodegradeable |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=4 May 2012 |first=Rebecca |last=Smithers |date=2 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204105012/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/02/teabags-biodegradeable |archive-date=4 December 2013 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loose tea ===
[[File:English Westminster Tea.jpg|thumb|A blend of loose-leaf black teas]]
The tea leaves are packaged loosely in a canister, paper bag, or other container such as a [[tea chest]]. Some whole teas, such as rolled gunpowder tea leaves, which resist crumbling, are vacuum-packed for freshness in [[BoPET|aluminised packaging]] for storage and retail. The loose tea is individually measured for use, allowing for flexibility and flavour control at the expense of convenience. Strainers, [[Infuser|tea balls]], tea presses, filtered teapots, and infusion bags prevent loose leaves from floating in the tea and over-brewing. A traditional method uses a three-piece lidded teacup called a [[gaiwan]], the lid of which is tilted to decant the tea into a different cup for consumption.

=== Compressed tea ===
[[Tea brick|Compressed tea]] (such as [[Pu'er tea|pu-erh]]) is produced for convenience in transport, storage, and ageing. It can usually be stored longer without spoilage than loose leaf tea. Compressed tea is prepared by loosening leaves from the cake using a small knife, and steeping the extracted pieces in water. During the Tang dynasty, as described by Lu Yu, compressed tea was ground into a powder, combined with hot water, and ladled into bowls, resulting in a "frothy" mixture.{{sfn|Mair|Hoh|2009|p=50}} In the [[Song dynasty]], the tea powder would instead be whisked with hot water in the bowl. Although no longer practiced in China today, the whisking method of preparing powdered tea was transmitted to Japan by [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks, and is still used to prepare [[matcha]] in the Japanese tea ceremony.{{sfn|Mair|Hoh|2009|p=62}}

Compressed tea was the most popular form of tea in China during the Tang dynasty.{{sfn|Mair|Hoh|2009|p=48}} By the beginning of the Ming dynasty, it had been displaced by loose-leaf tea.{{sfn|Mair|Hoh|2009|p=110}} It remains popular, however, in the Himalayan countries and Mongolian steppes. In Mongolia, tea bricks were ubiquitous enough to be used as a form of currency. Among Himalayan peoples, compressed tea is consumed by combining it with [[yak butter]] and salt to produce butter tea.{{sfn|Mair|Hoh|2009|pp=124–36}}

=== Instant tea ===
"Instant tea", similar to [[Freeze drying|freeze-dried]] [[instant coffee]] and an alternative to brewed tea, can be consumed either hot or cold. Instant tea was developed in the 1930s, with [[Nestlé]] introducing the first commercial product in 1946, while Redi-Tea debuted instant [[iced tea]] in 1953. Additives such as [[Masala chai|chai]], vanilla, honey or fruit, are popular, as is [[powdered milk]].

During the Second World War British and Canadian soldiers were issued an instant tea known as "compo" in their composite ration packs. These blocks of instant tea, powdered milk, and sugar were not always well received. As Royal Canadian Artillery Gunner, George C Blackburn observed:

{{quote|But, unquestionably, the feature of Compo rations destined to be remembered beyond all others is Compo tea...Directions say to "sprinkle powder on heated water and bring to the boil, stirring well, three heaped teaspoons to one pint of water."

Every possible variation in the preparation of this tea was tried, but...it always ended up the same way. While still too hot to drink, it is a good-looking cup of strong tea. Even when it becomes just cool enough to be sipped gingerly, it is still a good-tasting cup of tea, if you like your tea strong and sweet. But let it cool enough to be quaffed and enjoyed, and your lips will be coated with a sticky scum that forms across the surface, which if left undisturbed will become a leathery membrane that can be wound around your finger and flipped away...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackburn |first=George |title=The Guns of Normandy: A Soldier's Eye View, France 1944 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kL0hdkLlovgC&amp;pg=PT93 |isbn=978-1-55199-462-8 |access-date=10 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424075208/https://books.google.com/books?id=kL0hdkLlovgC&amp;pg=PT93 |archive-date=24 April 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Bottled and canned tea ===
{{main|Canned tea}}
Canned tea is sold prepared and ready to drink. It was introduced in 1981 in Japan. The first bottled tea was introduced by an Indonesian tea company, PT. Sinar Sosro in 1969 with the brand name Teh Botol Sosro (or Sosro bottled tea).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sosro.com/in/tehbotol-sosro#.VqsyodJ97Mw |title=PT.

== Storage ==
Storage conditions and type determine the [[shelf life]] of tea; that of black teas is greater than that of green teas. Some, such as flower teas, may last only a month or so. Others, such as pu-erh, improve with age. To remain fresh and prevent mold, tea needs to be stored away from heat, light, air, and moisture. Tea must be kept at room temperature in an air-tight container. Black tea in a bag within a sealed opaque canister may keep for two years. Green tea deteriorates more rapidly, usually in less than a year. Tightly rolled gunpowder tea leaves keep longer than the more open-leafed [[Chun Mee tea]].

Storage life for all teas can be extended by using [[desiccant]] or oxygen-absorbing packets, vacuum sealing, or refrigeration in air-tight containers (except green tea, where discrete use of refrigeration or freezing is recommended and temperature variation kept to a minimum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.o-cha.net/english/cup/pdf/29.pdf |title=Green Tea Storage |access-date=15 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327174214/http://www.o-cha.net/english/cup/pdf/29.pdf |archive-date=27 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent investigations, it has also been made clear that both varieties have the same chromosome number (n=15) and can be easily hybridised with each other. In addition, various types of intermediate hybrids or spontaneous polyploids of tea plants have been found in a wide area extending over the regions mentioned above. These facts may prove that the place of origin of ''Camellia sinensis'' is in the area including the northern part of the Burma, Yunnan, and Sichuan districts of China.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

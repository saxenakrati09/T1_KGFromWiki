The bank descends from the [[Bank of Calcutta]], founded in 1806 via the [[Imperial Bank of India]], making it the oldest commercial bank in the [[Indian Subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]]. The [[Bank of Madras]] merged into the other two presidency banks in [[British India]], the [[Bank of Calcutta]] and the [[Bank of Bombay]], to form the [[Imperial Bank of India]], which in turn became the State Bank of India in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rajesh |title=Banking Theory Law N Practice |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHCQsprFST4C&amp;q=allahabad+bank+established&amp;pg=PA8 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |page=8 |isbn= 9780070091238|access-date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of India]] took control of the Imperial Bank of India in 1955, with [[Reserve Bank of India]] (India's central bank) taking a 60% stake, renaming it State Bank of India.

==History==
[[File:State Bank of India 2005 stamp.jpg|right|thumb|Stamp dedicated to the State Bank of India in 2005]]
[[File:Bank of Bengal 1876.jpg|left|thumb|Share of the Bank of Bengal, issued 13 May 1876]]
[[File:SBI Imperial bank seal.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Seal of Imperial Bank of India.|Seal of Imperial Bank of India|188x188px]]
The roots of State Bank of India lie in the first decade of the 19th century when the [[Bank of Calcutta]] later renamed the [[Bank of Bengal]], was established on 2 June 1806. The Bank of Bengal was one of three Presidency banks, the other two being the [[Bank of Bombay]] (incorporated on 15 April 1840) and the [[Bank of Madras]] (incorporated on 1 July 1843). All three Presidency banks were incorporated as [[Joint stock company|joint stock companies]] and were the result of [[royal charter]]s. These three banks received the exclusive right to issue paper currency till 1861 when, with the Paper Currency Act, the right was taken over by the Government of India.  The Presidency banks amalgamated on 27 January 1921, and the re-organised banking entity took as its name [[Imperial Bank of India]]. The Imperial Bank of India remained a joint-stock company but without Government participation.

Pursuant to the provisions of the State Bank of India Act of 1955, the [[Reserve Bank of India]], which is [[Central Bank|India's central bank]], acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India. On 1 July 1955, the Imperial Bank of India became the State Bank of India. In 2008, the [[Government of India]] acquired the Reserve Bank of India's stake in SBI so as to remove any [[conflict of interest]] because the RBI is the country's banking regulatory authority.

In 1959, the government passed the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act. This made eight banks that had belonged to [[Indian Princely States|princely states]] into subsidiaries of SBI. This was at the time of the First Five Year Plan, which prioritised the development of rural India. The government integrated these banks into the State Bank of India system to expand its rural outreach. In 1963 SBI merged State Bank of Jaipur (est. 1943) and State Bank of Bikaner (est.1944).

SBI has acquired local banks in rescues. The first was the Bank of Bihar (est. 1911), which SBI acquired in 1969, together with its 28 branches. The next year SBI acquired National Bank of Lahore (est. 1942), which had 24 branches. Five years later, in 1975, SBI acquired Krishnaram Baldeo Bank, which had been established in 1916 in [[Gwalior State]], under the patronage of Maharaja [[Madho Rao Scindia]]. The bank had been the ''Dukan Pichadi'', a small moneylender, owned by the Maharaja. The new bank's first manager was Jall N. Broacha, a Parsi. In 1985, SBI acquired the Bank of Cochin in [[Kerala]], which had 120 branches. SBI was the acquirer as its affiliate, the [[State Bank of Travancore]], already had an extensive network in Kerala.

There was, even before it actually happened, a proposal to merge all the associate banks into SBI to create a single very large bank and streamline operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iba.org.in/viewmembanks.asp?id=2 |title=Indian Banks' Association |publisher=Iba.org.in |date=23 April 2005 |access-date=21 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721180611/http://www.iba.org.in/viewmembanks.asp?id=2 |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step towards unification occurred on 13 August 2008 when [[State Bank of Saurashtra]] merged with SBI, reducing the number of associate state banks from seven to six. On 19 June 2009, the SBI board approved the absorption of [[State Bank of Indore]], in which SBI held 98.3%. (Individuals who held the shares prior to its takeover by the government held the balance of 1.7%.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Approvals for State Bank of Indore merger by July: SBI |url= http://www.cmlinks.com/sbi/NewsText.asp?Code=1375&amp;period=1001&amp;srno=9172002038 |date= 21 June 2010 |author= Business Standard |access-date= 28 June 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708170155/http://www.cmlinks.com/sbi/NewsText.asp?Code=1375&amp;period=1001&amp;srno=9172002038 |archive-date= 8 July 2011 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition of State Bank of Indore added 470 branches to SBI's existing network of branches. Also, following the acquisition, SBI's total assets approached {{INR}}10 trillion. The total assets of SBI and the [[State Bank of Indore]] were {{INR}}9,981,190 million as of March 2009. The process of merging of State Bank of Indore was completed by April 2010, and the SBIndore branches started functioning as SBI branches on 26 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= State Bank of Indore branches to become SBI units from Aug 26 : SBI |url= http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Banking/articleshow/6434466.cms |date= 26 August 2010 |author= Economic Times |work= The Times of India |access-date= 26 August 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161008235522/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Banking/articleshow/6434466.cms |archive-date= 8 October 2016 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2013, [[Arundhati Bhattacharya]] became the first woman to be appointed Chairperson of the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Arundhati Bhattacharya, the first woman to head SBI |newspaper = The Hindu|date = 7 October 2013| url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/arundhati-bhattacharya-first-woman-to-head-sbi/article5210836.ece?homepage=true | access-date=8 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004545/http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/arundhati-bhattacharya-first-woman-to-head-sbi/article5210836.ece?homepage=true | archive-date=3 December 2013 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Bhattacharya received an extension of two years of service to merge into SBI the five remaining associate banks.

In 1989, SBI established an offshore bank, State Bank of India International (Mauritius) Ltd.

Today, SBI (Mauritius) Ltd has 14 branches – 13 retail branches and 1 global business branch at Ebene in Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbimauritius.com/new/files/about.php Bank to Grow with] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502153606/http://www.sbimauritius.com/new/files/about.php |date=2 May 2017 }}.

===Former Associate Banks===
[[File: SBI Mumbai Main Branch.jpg|right|thumb|alt=SBI main branch at Mumbai lit up| Main Branch of SBI in Mumbai]]
SBI acquired the control of seven banks in 1960. They were the seven regional banks of former Indian princely states. They were renamed, prefixing them with 'State Bank of'. These seven banks were [[State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur]] (SBBJ), [[State Bank of Hyderabad]] (SBH), [[State Bank of Indore]] (SBN), [[State Bank of Mysore]] (SBM), [[State Bank of Patiala]] (SBP),  [[State Bank of Saurashtra]] (SBS)  and [[State Bank of Travancore]] (SBT). All these banks were given the same logo as the parent bank, SBI. State Bank of India and all its associate banks used the same blue ''Keyhole'' logo said to have been inspired by [[Ahmedabad|Ahmedabad's]] [[Kankaria Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=19 February 2014|title=SBI bank logo was inspired by Kankaria lake|url=https://www.deshgujarat.com/2014/02/19/sbi-logo-was-inspired-by-kankaria-lake/|access-date=3 August 2020|website=DeshGujarat|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Bank of India [[wordmark]] usually had one standard typeface, but also utilised other typefaces. The wordmark now has the keyhole logo followed by "SBI".

The plans for making SBI a single very large bank by merging the associate banks started in 2008, and in September the same year, SBS merged with SBI. The very next year, State Bank of Indore (SBN) also merged.
